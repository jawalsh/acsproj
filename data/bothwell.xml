                        <l n="42"> I would not do it to him that I most hate; </l>

                        <l n="56"> How to put this in hand: for all I find, </l>
                        <l n="57"> This man I here endure to play upon </l>
                        <l n="58"> Lives now in great suspicion; yet my word </l>
                        <l n="59"> Hath credit with him, but not far enough </l>
                        <l n="60"> For him to show me anything; but yet </l>
                        <l n="61"> I shall draw forth of him what thing I will </l>

                        <l n="64"> The trust of any that puts trust in me; </l>

                        <l n="66"> And though by checks and hints of that I feared </l>
                        <l n="67"> This man sometimes even touch me to the quick </l>
                        <l n="68"> With words dropt of mine honour and my power </l>
                        <l n="69"> On mine own self, whereby I surely know </l>
                        <l n="70"> That he suspects him of the thing we wot </l>
                        <l n="71"> And of his life, yet as to that last fear </l>
                        <l n="72"> I need but say some three good words to him </l>
                        <l n="73"> And he rejoices, and is out of doubt. </l>
                        <l n="74"> He was seen never as gay of mood as now </l>
                        <l n="75"> When I make show of grace and gentle heart, </l>
                        <l n="76"> And puts me in remembrance of all things </l>
                        <l n="77"> That may assure my faith he loves me well. </l>
                        <l n="78"> Let not my love suspect me for his sake, </l>
                        <l n="79"> Who take such great joy of his love-making </l>
                        <l n="80"> That I come never where he is but straight </l>
                        <l n="81"> I take the sickness of my sore side here, </l>
                        <l n="82"> I am vexed so with it; wearied might he be, </l>
                        <l n="83"> This poisonous man that gives me all this pain </l>
                        <l n="84"> When I would speak of things far sweeter; yet </l>
                        <l n="85"> He is marred not overmuch of form or face </l>
                        <l n="86"> Though he have borne much, and his venomed breath </l>
                        <l n="87"> Hath almost slain me though I sit far off. </l>
                        <l n="88"> He would have had me watch with him, but I </l>
                        <l n="89"> Put off the night; he says he sleeps not sound; </l>
                        <l n="90"> He never spake more humbly nor more well; </l>
                        <l n="91"> And if I had not proven his heart of wax </l>
                        <l n="92"> And were not mine cut of a diamond </l>
                        <l n="93"> Whereinto no shot ever can make breach </l>
                        <l n="94"> But that which flies forth of mine own love's hand, </l>
                        
                        <l n="95"> I had almost had pity of him; but say </l>
                        <l n="96"> I bid the captain of my fortressed heart </l>
                        <l n="97"> Fear not; the place shall hold unto the death. </l>
                        <l n="98"> And bid my love in recompense thereof </l>
                        <l n="99"> Let not his own be won by that false kind </l>
                        <l n="100"> That will no less strive with him for the same. </l>
                        <l n="101"> I think the twain were trained up in one school, </l>
                        <l n="102"> For he hath ever tear in eye, and makes </l>
                        <l n="103"> Most piteous moan to arouse men's pity, yea, </l>
                        <l n="104"> Humbly salutes them all, even to the least, </l>
                        <l n="105"> To make their hearts soft toward him; and desires </l>
                        <l n="106"> That with mine own hands I would give him meat; </l>
                        <l n="107"> But let my lord, where he is, give no more trust </l>
                        <l n="108"> Than I shall here. Tell him all this; and say </l>
                        <l n="109"> I am in the doing here of a work I hate </l>
                        <l n="110"> Past measure; and should make him fain to laugh </l>
                        <l n="111"> To see me lie so well, or at the least </l>
                        <l n="112"> So well dissemble, and tell him truth 'twixt hands. </l>
                        <l n="113"> Say, by the flatteries I perforce must make </l>
                        <l n="114"> And prayers to him to assure himself of me, </l>
                        <l n="115"> And by complaint made of the men designed, </l>
                        <l n="116"> I have drawn out of him all we list to know </l>
                        <l n="117"> Yet never touched one word of that your lord </l>
                        <l n="118"> Showed me, but only wrought by wiles; and say </l>
                        <l n="119"> With two false kinds we are coupled, I and he, </l>
                        <l n="120"> My love; the devil dissever us, and God </l>
                        <l n="121"> Knit us together for the faithfullest pair </l>
                        <l n="122"> That ever he made one; this is my faith, </l>
                        <l n="123"> I will die in it. Excuse me to my lord </l>
                        <l n="124"> That I writ ill last night, being ill at ease, </l>
                        
                        <l n="125"> And when the rest were sleeping was most glad </l>
                        <l n="126"> To write unto him, who might no more, nor could </l>
                        <l n="127"> Sleep as they did and as I would desire, </l>
                        <l n="128"> Even in my dear love's arms; whom I pray God </l>
                        <l n="129"> Keep from all evil and send him all repose. </l>
                        <l n="130"> And being so long my letter hindered me </l>
                        <l n="131"> To write what tidings of myself I would, </l>
                        <l n="132"> Who had wrought before for two hours of the day </l>

                        <l n="136"> Though that mine hands might end it yestereve </l>
                        <l n="137"> I would not see the man; but this mean time </l>
                        <l n="138"> I think to make one fairer; let him not </l>
                        <l n="139"> Bring it in sight of any that was here, </l>
                        <l n="140"> For all would know it, seeing it was wrought for haste </l>
                        <l n="141"> In sight of them; yet might it bring some harm </l>
                        <l n="142"> And may be seen if he should chance be hurt; </l>
                        <l n="143"> Let him send word if he will have it, and say </l>
                        <l n="144"> If he will have more gold by you, and when </l>
                        <l n="145"> I shall return, and how far I may speak; </l>
                        <l n="146"> For this man waxes mad to hear of him </l>
                        <l n="147"> Or of my brother; and when I visit him </l>
                        <l n="148"> His friends come all to be my convoy, say, </l>
                        <l n="149"> And he desires me come the morn betimes </l>
                        <l n="150"> And see him rise. This letter that I send, </l>
                        <l n="151"> Bid my lord burn it, being so dangerous, </l>
                        <l n="152"> With nought in it well said,—for all my mind </l>
                        <l n="153"> Was on this craft I loath to think upon— </l>
                        <l n="154"> And if it find his hand in Edinburgh, </l>

                        <l n="156"> Be not offended, since to doubts of him </l>
                        <l n="157"> I give not o'er-great credit; but say this, </l>
                        <l n="158"> That seeing to obey him, who is my dear heart's love, </l>
                        <l n="159"> I spare nor honour, conscience, hazard, state, </l>

                        <l n="36"> With that swift singing; then as fire drops down </l>
                        <l n="37"> Dropped, and was quenched, and in joy's stead I felt </l>
                        <l n="38"> Fear ache in me like hunger; and I saw </l>

                        <l n="40"> But a blind vault more thick and gross than earth, </l>

                        <l n="43"> The sea of tears and fire below the world </l>

                        <l n="48"> Severing; and fain I would have cried on God, </l>
                        <l n="49"> But that the rank air took me by the throat; </l>
                        
                        <l n="50"> And ever she that sat on the sea-rock </l>

                        <l n="52"> With bones of men whose souls were turned to fire; </l>
                        <l n="53"> And if she were or were not what I thought </l>

                        <l n="55"> For ere we came to split upon that reef </l>
                        <l n="56"> The sundering planks opened, and through their breach </l>
                        <l n="57"> Swarmed in the dense surf of the dolorous sea </l>
                        <l n="58"> With hands that plucked and tongues thrust out at us, </l>
                        <l n="59"> And fastened on me flamelike, that my flesh </l>
                        <l n="60"> Was molten as with earthly fire, and dropped </l>
                        <l n="61"> From naked bone and sinew; but mine eyes </l>
                        <l n="62"> The hot surf seared not, nor put out my sense; </l>
                        <l n="63"> For I beheld and heard out of the surge </l>
                        <l n="64"> Voices that shrieked and heads that rose, and knew </l>
                        <l n="65"> Whose all they were, and whence their wrath at me; </l>
                        <l n="66"> For all these cried upon me that mine ears </l>
                        <l n="67"> Rang, and my brain was like as beaten brass, </l>
                        <l n="68"> Vibrating; and the froth of that foul tide </l>
                        <l n="69"> Was as their spittle shot in my full face </l>
                        <l n="70"> That burnt it; and with breast and flanks distent </l>
                        <l n="71"> I strained myself to curse them back, and lacked </l>

                        <l n="119"> There left me quick entombed in stone, and hid </l>
                        <l n="120"> Too deep for the day's eyeshot; then I woke </l>
                        <l n="121"> With the sea's roaring and the wind's by night </l>
                        <l n="122"> Fresh in my sense, and on my travailing heart </l>
                        <l n="123"> A weight of walls and floors and upper earth </l>
                        <l n="124"> That held me down below the breach o'the sea </l>

                        <l n="154"> So great a charge. You had word ere this of me </l>
                        <l n="155"> By what strange fortune was their plot made known </l>
                        <l n="156"> Who thought to fall upon us unaware </l>
                        <l n="157"> And find a ferry for some seventy swords </l>

                        <l n="197"> Or but by some sweet note of majesty, </l>
