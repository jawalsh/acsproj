                                <p xml:id="d1e512" rendition="#i">As it has pleased you to disinter this buried
                                        bantling of your friend’s literary youth, and to find it
                                        worth resurrection, I must inscribe it to you as the person
                                        responsible for its revival. Were it not that a friend’s
                                        judgment may always seem liable to be coloured by the
                                        unconscious influence of friendship, I should be reassured
                                        as to its deserts by the approval of a master from whose
                                        verdict on a stranger’s attempt in the creative art of
                                        fiction there could be no reasonable appeal—and who, I
                                        feel bound to acknowledge with gratitude and satisfaction,
                                        has honoured it by the sponsorial suggestion of a new and a
                                        happier name. As it is, I can only hope that you may not be
                                        for once mistaken in your favourable opinion of a study
                                        thrown into the old epistolary form which even the giant
                                        genius of <persName xml:id="d1e514">Balzac</persName> could not restore to
                                        the <pb xml:id="d1e517" n="vi" facs="acs0000005-01-013"/> favour it
                                        enjoyed in the days of <persName xml:id="d1e519">Richardson</persName> and
                                        of <persName xml:id="d1e522">Laclos</persName>. However that may be, I am
                                        content to know that you agree with me in thinking that in
                                        the world of literary creation there is a legitimate place
                                        for that apparent compromise between a story and a play by
                                        which the alternate agents and patients of the tale are made
                                        to express what befalls them by word of mouth or of pen. I
                                        do not forget that the king of men to whose hand we owe the
                                        glorious history of <title xml:id="d1e525">Redgauntlet</title> began it in
                                        epistolary form and changed the fashion of his tale to direct
                                        and forthright narrative when the story became too strong
                                        for him, and would no longer be confined within the limits
                                        of conceivable correspondence: but his was in its ultimate
                                        upshot a historic and heroic story. And I have always
                                        regretted that we have but one specimen of the uncompleted
                                        series of letters out of which an earlier novel, the
                                        admirable <title xml:id="d1e529">Fortunes of Nigel</title>, had grown up
                                        into immortality. The single sample which

                                                be remembered by all those interested in social

                                                some nine years of active life before him—public

                                                character almost painfully perfect. The mutual moral

                                                singular turn. Mr. Cheyne was a Socialist—a Democrat
                                                of the most advanced kind. The father was quite

                                                society. The wrongs of women gave him many a

                                                than otherwise. The fact of this mutual repulsion
                                                had nothing to do with philanthropy. It was
                                                undeniable; but, on the other hand, the
                                                moral-sublime of this young man’s character was
                                                something incredible. Unlike his father, he was much
                                                worried by religious speculations—certain phases of
                                                belief and disbelief he saw fit to embody in a

                                                disgraceful for its stupidity and cruelty—such a
                                                nice little fellow the child was, too, not the least
                                                like him, but the image of his mother and of her
                                                (Lady Midhurst), which of course was reason enough
                                                for that ruffian to ill-use his own son. There was
                                                one comfort, she had leave to write to the boy, and
                                                go now and then to see him; and she took care to
                                                encourage him in his revolt against his father’s
                                                style of training. In effect, as far as she could,
                                                Lady Midhurst tried to instil into her grandson her
                                                own views of his father’s character; it was not
                                                difficult, seeing that father and son were utterly

                                                an ex-captain; his elder brother had died before he
                                                paid court to Miss Midhurst, and, when he married,
                                                the captain had land to settle on. As a younger
                                                brother, Lady Midhurst had liked him extremely; as a
                                                man of marriageable income, she gave him her
                                                daughter, and fell at once to hating him. </p>

                                                a governess, who took her well in hand at an early
                                                age, and kept her apart from all influence but her
                                                own; Frank under the lazy kind incurious eyes of his

                                                now and then exchanged visits with his brother, but
                                                not often; and the children not unnaturally were
                                                quite incapable of appreciating the earnest
                                                single-minded philanthropy of the excellent

                                                did. But there was one man, or boy, whom John Cheyne

                                                John Cheyne would have scented a nascent inclination
                                                on his nephew’s part towards his daughter. There was
                                                a sort of weakly weary gentleness of manner in the
                                                young philanthropist which the girl soon began to
                                                appreciate. Clara showed early enough a certain
                                                acuteness, and a relish of older company, which gave
                                                promise of some practical ability. At thirteen she
                                                had good ideas of management, and was a match for
                                                her father in most things. But she could not make
                                                him tolerate his nephew; she could only turn his
                                                antipathy to profit by letting it throw forward into
                                                relief her own childish friendliness. There was the
                                                composition of a good intriguer in the girl from the
                                                first; she had a desirable power of making all that
                                                could be made out of every chance of enjoyment. She
                                                was never one to let the present slip. Few children
                                                have such a keen sense as she how infinitely

                                                ever now rode over to see his ex-friend; not that he
                                                had any quarrel with the uncle of his divorced wife,
                                                but he now scarcely ever stirred out or sought any
                                                company beyond a few professional men of his own

                                                an imputation; he was merely a grave, dry, shy,

                                                pleasure in the sense that his son was being trained
                                                up sharply and warily; but did not a boy with such

                                                conspicuous for any event in his life but that
                                                elopement; and how matters even then had come to a
                                                crisis between two such lovers as they were,
                                                probably only one person on earth could have told;
                                                and this third person certainly was not the bereaved
                                                captain. The daughter was from her birth of that
                                                rare and singular beauty which never changes for the
                                                worse in growing older. She was one of the few girls
                                                who have no ugly time. In this spring of 1849 she
                                                was the most perfect child of eight that can be
                                                imagined. There was a strange grave beauty and
                                                faultless grace about her, more noticeable than the
                                                more usual points of childish prettiness: pureness
                                                of feature, ample brilliant hair, perfect little
                                                lips, serious and rounded in shape, and wonderful
                                                unripe beauty of chin and throat. Her grandmother,

                                                old life-worn philosophic lady seemed absolutely to
                                                riot and revel in her fondness for the child. There
                                                was always a certain amiably cynical side to her
                                                affections, which showed itself by and by in the
                                                girl’s training; but the delight and love aroused in
                                                her at the sight of her pupil were as true and
                                                tender as such emotions could be in such a woman.
                                                Lady Midhurst was really very much fonder of her two
                                                grandchildren than of any one else alive. Redgie was
                                                just her sort of boy, she said, and Amy just her
                                                sort of girl. It would have been delicious to bring
                                                them up together (education, superintendence,
                                                training of character, guidance of habit, in young
                                                people, were passions with the excellent lady); and
                                                if the boy’s father would just be good enough to
                                                come to some timely end——. She had been godmother to
                                                both children, and both were as fond of her as

                                                the country house which Mr. John Cheyne had
                                                inherited from his wife. This was a little old
                                                house, beautifully set in among orchards and
                                                meadows, with abundance of roses now all round it,
                                                under the heavy leaves of a spring that June was
                                                fast gaining upon. A wide soft river divided the
                                                marsh meadows in front of it, full of yellow
                                                flag-flowers and moist fen-blossom. Behind, there

                                                midst of spring; only the upper half of it clear out

                                                boy went to school so young, though no doubt his
                                                father had picked out the very hardest sort of
                                                school that he decently could select. Anything was

                                                first brought his son over to his old friend’s.
                                                Perhaps he thought at length that the boy might as
                                                well see some one about his own age in holiday-time.
                                                Reginald was growing visibly mutinous and hard to
                                                keep down by preachings and punishments; had begun
                                                evidently to wince and kick under the domestic rod.
                                                His father and the clerical tutor who came over
                                                daily to look after the boy’s holiday task could
                                                hardly keep him under by frequent flogging and much
                                                serious sorrowful lecturing. He was not a specially
                                                fast boy, only about as restless and insubordinate
                                                as most fellows at his age; but this was far more
                                                than his father was prepared to stand. Let him see
                                                some one else outside home than Lady Midhurst; it
                                                would do him no harm, and the boy was always
                                                vicious, and jibbed frightfully, for some days after
                                                his grandmother’s visits. So before the holidays
                                                were out the Captain trotted him over to make
                                                friends with Mr. Cheyne’s son. The visit was a
                                                matter of keen and rather frightened interest to
                                                Frank. Clara, on hearing the boy was her junior,
                                                made light of it, and was out of the way when

                                                bright pale skin. His mouth, with a rather full red

                                                that night and licked me with a whip; with a whip
                                                like this. He was a most awful bully. I don’t think

                                                were metallic, and the brows heavy, shaggy even. He

                                                seemingly had but just result enough to establish a

                                                Cheyne and his second cousin—a tie considerably
                                                broken in upon by various squabbles, and strained
                                                often almost to snapping; but, for all that, the
                                                visit had left its mark on both sides, and had its

                                                His researches in osteology were of especial value
                                                and interest; he was in all ways a man of great

                                                time, with an eye to the bar in years to come; his
                                                father’s property had been much cut into by the
                                                share assigned to his sister, and there was just a
                                                fair competence left him to start upon. When not at
                                                Oxford, he lived usually at Lidcombe or at
                                                Blocksham, seldom by himself at home; but had for
                                                some little time past shown a distinct preference of
                                                his cousin’s house to his brother-in-law’s, Lord
                                                Cheyne and he being always on the pleasantest terms.
                                                With this cousin, eighteen years older than himself,
                                                he got on now much better than with his old
                                                companion Reginald Harewood, whose Oxford career had
                                                just ended in the passing over his hapless head of

                                                  sharing Mr. Radworth’s enjoyment of it. (I trust
                                                  his sight is improving steadily.) But for all this

                                                  mother, and in consequence hers also. Indeed, I
                                                  believe he was in love with me at the time, though
                                                  I am ten years older; however, I imagine it looks
                                                  the other way now. When I saw him last he was
                                                  greyer than Ernest Radworth. That wife of his (E.
                                                  R.’s, I mean) is enough to turn any man’s hair
                                                  grey; I assure you, my dear child, she makes my
                                                  three hairs stand on end. Her style is something
                                                  too awful, like the most detestable sort of young
                                                  man. She will be the ruin of poor dear Redgie if
                                                  we don’t pick him up somehow and keep him out of
                                                  her way. He was quite the nicest boy I ever knew,
                                                  and used to make me laugh by the hour; there was a

                                                  Radworth, I suppose, calls pluck or go. Still,

                                                  be the death of poor Redgie. He was always the
                                                  most unfortunate boy on this earth; I dare say you

                                                  punished and sermonized, ever since he was a
                                                  perfect baby; enough to drive any boy mad, and get
                                                  him into an infinity of the most awful scrapes
                                                  when he grew up : but I did think he might have
                                                  kept out of this one. Clara Radworth must be at

                                                  has taken to painting already. If there was only a

                                                  know I never had any great liking for my nephew
                                                  Francis. His father was certainly the stupider of
                                                  my two brothers; and, my dear, you have no idea
                                                  what that implies. If you had known your husband’s
                                                  father, your own great-uncle, you would not
                                                  believe me when I say his brother was stupider.
                                                  But John was; I suppose there never was a greater
                                                  idiot than John. Rather a clever idiot, too, and
                                                  used to work and live desperately hard on
                                                  occasion; but, good Heavens! And I can’t help
                                                  thinking the children take after him in some
                                                  things. Clara to be sure is the image of her
                                                  mother—a portentous image it is, and I do
                                                  sometimes think one ought to try and be sorry for
                                                  Ernest Radworth, but I positively cannot; and
                                                  Frank is not without his points of likeness to
                                                  her. Still the father will crop out, as people say
                                                  nowadays in their ugly slang. Keep an eye on the
                                                  father, my dear, and compare him with your husband
                                                  when he does turn up. I don’t want you to be rude
                                                  to anybody, or to put yourself out of the way in
                                                  the least. Only not to trust either of those two
                                                  cousins too far. As for Cheyne’s liking for Clara
                                                  Radworth, I wouldn’t vex myself about that. She

                                                  your husband against her. She will not try

                                                  fortnight’s time, and shall certainly not return
                                                  to Oxford (if I do at all) till the summer term. I
                                                  really wonder you should think it worth while to
                                                  dwell for a second on what Lady Midhurst may
                                                  choose to say : for I cannot suppose you have any
                                                  other grounds to go on than this letter of hers;
                                                  and certainly I do not intend to alter my plans in
                                                  the least on account of her absurdities. You must
                                                  remember what our father used to say about her ”
                                                  impotent incontinence of tongue.” I should be
                                                  ashamed to let a vicious, virulent old aunt
                                                  influence me in any way. I am fond of our cousins,
                                                  and enjoy being with them; it is a nice house to
                                                  stay at, and, as long as we all enjoy being there
                                                  together, I cannot see why we should listen to any
                                                  spiteful and senseless commentaries. To meet you

                                                  suggest. As to Amicia, I think she is very
                                                  delightful to be with, and fond of us all in a
                                                  friendly amiable way; and I know she is very
                                                  beautiful and agreeable to look at or talk to,
                                                  which never spoils anything; but as to falling in
                                                  love, you must have the sense to know that nobody
                                                  over eighteen, or out of a bad French novel, would
                                                  run his head into such a mess : to say nothing of
                                                  the absurdity or the villainy of such a thing. It
                                                  all comes of the ridiculous and infamous sort of
                                                  reading which I have no doubt the dear aunt
                                                  privately indulges in. I do hope you will never
                                                  quote her authority to me again, even in chaff. I
                                                  never can believe that she really had the bringing
                                                  up of Amicia in her own hands; it is wonderful how
                                                  little of the Midhurst mark has been left on <emph xml:id="d1e1916" rendition="#i">her</emph>. I suppose her father was
                                                  a nicer sort of fellow to begin with; for as to
                                                  our cousin Mrs. Stanford, one can hardly suppose
                                                  that she bequeathed Amy an antidote to her own
                                                  blood. I am sure her son has enough of the

                                                  and I have met him two or three times. I agree

                                                  with a decent set of verses for once in a way. I
                                                  dare say he will be rather an available sort of
                                                  inmate at Lidcombe : you will have to put up with
                                                  him at all events if you go, for I believe he is
                                                  there already. Really, if you can get on with him
                                                  at first, I think you will find there are worse
                                                  fellows going. It appears, for one thing, that his
                                                  admiration of you is immense. He does me the
                                                  honour to seek me out, rather with a view I
                                                  suppose of getting me to talk about you. That

                                                  something more of them at last. I have always

                                                  seem to me the most quiet, innocuous, good sort of

                                                  your violent theories and enthusiasms, but a nice
                                                  peaceable spirit of research never puts out
                                                  anybody. I remember thinking Mr. Radworth’s
                                                  excitement and delight about his last subject of

                                                  I am very glad he has such a good one, but he is

                                                  allowance for contingent results. So, you see, you

                                                  women I know, but nothing more. Her tone is,
                                                  distinctly, bad. She has the sense to know this,
                                                  but not to improve it. The best thing I have ever
                                                  noticed about her is that, under these
                                                  circumstances, she resolves to make the most of
                                                  it. And I quite allow she is very effective when
                                                  at her best—very taking, especially with boys.
                                                  When she was quite little, she was the delight of
                                                  male playfellows; girls always detested her, as
                                                  women do now. (You may put down my harsh judgment
                                                  of her to the score of my being a woman, if you
                                                  think one can be a woman at my age—a thing I

                                                  smallest share of brains to start with.) She can’t

                                                  worse. I prefer Amicia, I must say; but, when one

                                                  the existence of that woman,—or Lucretia Fielding
                                                  (you must have seen her at Lidcombe); but, if I
                                                  had had a niece like that, I should have died of

                                                  and cold. If you will take my word for that fact,

                                                  into the bargain. A person who does happen to

                                                  She can enjoy herself, her excitability secures
                                                  that; and she will never enjoy herself too much or
                                                  pay too high a price for anything. These people
                                                  are always exceedingly acute, unless they are
                                                  absolute dunces, and then they hardly count. I
                                                  don’t mean that their acuteness prevents them from

                                                  dangerous a variety. If she ever does get an
                                                  impulse, God help her friends; but there will be
                                                  no fear even then for herself: not the least. Only

                                                  well aware the man is an exquisite painter, with
                                                  no end of genius and great qualities in his work;
                                                  but I declare he made a mull of that picture. It
                                                  was what fellows call a fiasco—complete. Imagine

                                                  all that splendid hair of hers done up in some
                                                  beastly way. And then people say the geraniums and

                                                  some such rot; when the fellow ought to have
                                                  painted her out of doors, or on horseback, or
                                                  something. I wish I could sit a horse half as

                                                  miles good, and all hard sand; the finest ground
                                                  possible; when I was staying here as a boy I used
                                                  to go out with the grooms before breakfast, and
                                                  exercise the horses there instead of taking them
                                                  up to the downs. She had been out of spirits in
                                                  the morning, and wanted the excitement to set her
                                                  up. I never saw her look so magnificent; her hair
                                                  was blown down and fell in heavy uncurling heaps
                                                  to her waist; her face looked out of the frame of
                                                  it, hot and bright, with the eyes lighted,

                                                  eyelids of hers. I could hardly speak to her for
                                                  pleasure, I confess; don’t show my avowals. I rode
                                                  between her and the sea, a thought behind; a gust
                                                  of wind blowing off land drove a wave of her hair
                                                  across my face, upon my lips; she felt it somehow,
                                                  I suppose, for she turned and laughed. When we

                                                  father’s. Don’t I remember the holiday dinners
                                                  there!—a parson, a stray military man of the
                                                  stodgier kind, my tutor, and the pater; I kept
                                                  after dinner to be chaffed, or lectured, or
                                                  examined—a jolly time that was. Well, I imagine
                                                  her life is about as pleasant; or worse, for she
                                                  can hardly get out to go about at all. People come
                                                  there with cases of objects, curiosities, stones
                                                  and bones and books, and lumber the whole place.
                                                  She had to receive three scientific professors
                                                  last month; two of them noted osteologists, she

                                                  more deeply than we fancied by the things that
                                                  were said this winter. Her manner is often queer
                                                  and nervous, with a way of catching herself up she
                                                  has lately taken to—breaking off her sentences and
                                                  fretting her lip or hand. I wish at times I had
                                                  never come back. If I had stayed up last Christmas
                                                  to read, as I thought of doing, there would have
                                                  been nothing for people to talk of. Now I
                                                  certainly shall not think of reading for a degree.
                                                  Perhaps I may go abroad, with Harewood if I can
                                                  get no one else. He is the sort of fellow to go
                                                  anywhere, and make himself rather available than

                                                  I was reading to her once, and Cheyne came in; she
                                                  grew hot, not very red, but hot and nervous, and I

                                                  I said Lady M. always seemed to me to live and
                                                  think in a yellow-paper French novel cover, with
                                                  some of the pages loose in sewing; then A. said
                                                  there was a true side to that way of looking at
                                                  things. So you see we were in the thick of

                                                  effective and soft, and her cheeks so perfect in
                                                  cutting. I cannot see the great likeness of

                                                  in words is so dangerous. Without sentiment one
                                                  would do all the good one did either by principle

                                                  would be genuine and valuable. Sinning in the same

                                                  truly and deeply care about the least thing that
                                                  touches you. To me you are two; you carry your

                                                  to. You have seen a good deal of your cousin for
                                                  the last six weeks, and are vaguely unhappy at his
                                                  going. (Once or twice, I am to infer, there has
                                                  been a touch of softer sentiment in your relations
                                                  to each other.) Not, I presume, that either has
                                                  dreamt of falling in love : but you live in a bad
                                                  time for intimacies; a time seasoned with
                                                  sentiment to that extent that you can never taste
                                                  the natural flavour of a sensation. You were
                                                  afraid of Clara too, a little; disliked her; left
                                                  her to Cheyne or to Reginald, as the case might be
                                                  (one result of which, by the by, is that I shall
                                                  have to extricate your brother, half eaten, from

                                                  impulse, without a purpose under it, towards her

                                                  uneventful days. The recollection that you have
                                                  not given me a single incident—nothing by way of
                                                  news but a frightened analysis of feeling and
                                                  record of sentimental experience—makes me
                                                  seriously uneasy. Write again and tell me your
                                                  plans: but for Heaven’s sake begin moving; get
                                                  something done; engage yourself in some active way
                                                  of amusement. Have done with the country and its

                                                  present. London is a wholesomer and more

                                                  family complications, and have come to some
                                                  understanding of them. When I wrote to you last
                                                  month I was out of spirits, and no doubt very
                                                  stupid and obscure. I had a dim impression of
                                                  things being wrong, and no means of guessing how
                                                  to get them right. Now, I must say I see no real
                                                  chance of anything unfortunate or unpleasant. You
                                                  must be cautious, though, of letting people begin

                                                  companions. I rested for a day or two, and then

                                                  understated his real age. I have no doubt, though,
                                                  he will live for ages (I don’t mean his
                                                  reputation, but his bodily frame); unless, indeed,
                                                  she poisons him—I am certain she would, if she
                                                  durst. She herself looks older; I trust, in a year
                                                  or two, she will have ceased to be at all
                                                  dangerous, even for boys. We had a curious
                                                  interview; not that day, but a week after. I saw
                                                  Reginald next day; he is mad on that score, quite.
                                                  I like to see such a capacity for craziness; it
                                                  looks as if a man had some corresponding capacity
                                                  for being reasonable when his time came. He never

                                                  appears; there is an incomparable manner about the
                                                  least thing she does. She is gloriously good,

                                                  pity, a royal forbearance, a divine defiance of
                                                  evil, and various qualities which must ennoble any
                                                  man she speaks to. To look at her is to be made
                                                  brave and just; to hear her talk is a lay baptism,
                                                  out of which the spirit of the auditor comes forth

                                                  Accepting these assertions as facts (remarkable
                                                  perhaps, but indisputable), I desired to know
                                                  whether Ernest Radworth was my friend’s ideal of
                                                  the glorified man?—heroic as a martyr he
                                                  certainly was, I allowed, in a passive way. If a
                                                  passing acquaintance becomes half deified by the
                                                  touch of her, I put it to him frankly, what must
                                                  not her husband have grown into by this time,
                                                  after six years of marriage? Reginald was of
                                                  opinion that on him the divine influence must have
                                                  acted the wrong way. The man being irredeemably
                                                  bad, abject, stupid, there was nothing noble to be
                                                  called out and respond to her. The only result,
                                                  therefore, of being always close to the noblest
                                                  nature created was, in men like him, a justly
                                                  ordained increase of degradation. Those that under
                                                  such an influence cannot kindle into the

                                                  his deliberate belief. Experience of character,
                                                  study of life, the evidence of common sense,
                                                  combined to lead him unwilling to this awful
                                                  inference. But then, how splendid was her conduct,
                                                  how laudable her endurance of him, how admirable
                                                  in every way her conjugal position! I suggested

                                                  and hear what she had to say. She had a good deal.
                                                  I always said she could talk well; this time she
                                                  talked admirably. She went into moral anatomy with

                                                  thirty—that I admit. She handled the question in
                                                  an abstract indifferent way wonderful to see. The
                                                  whole thing was taken up on high grounds, and
                                                  treated in a grand spirit of research—worthy of
                                                  her husband. She did not even profess to regard
                                                  Redgie as a brother—or friend. In effect she did

                                                  thought at once. He amused her; she liked him,

                                                  two. She took the hint exquisitely: was evidently
                                                  not certain she understood, but had a vague
                                                  apprehension of the thing meant; fell back finally
                                                  upon a noble self-reliance, and took the pure
                                                  English tone. The suggestion of any harm resulting
                                                  was of course left untouched: such a chance as

                                                  something to admire on each hand. And the

                                                  goodness makes the entire affair more dangerous

                                                  not think him likely to be carried off his feet
                                                  for long. Console yourself, if you want the
                                                  comfort; we have no thought of marrying him. He is
                                                  best unattached. At the present writing he no
                                                  doubt thinks more of you than <emph xml:id="d1e2493" rendition="#i">she</emph> would admit. I regret it; but he does.
                                                  Do you, my dear child, take care and keep out of
                                                  the way just now. I hear (from Ernest Radworth;
                                                  his wife said nothing of it; in fact, when he
                                                  began speaking the corners of her mouth and
                                                  eyelids flinched with vexation—just for a breath
                                                  of time) that there is some talk now of a summer
                                                  seaside expedition. Redgie of course; Frank of
                                                  course; the Radworths, and you two. I beg you not
                                                  to think of it. Why on earth should you all lounge
                                                  and toss about together in that heavy way? You
                                                  are off to London at last, or will be in ten days’
                                                  time, you say; at least, before May begins. Stay
                                                  there till it breaks up; and then go either north
                                                  or abroad. Yachts are ridiculous, and I know you
                                                  will upset yourself. To be sure sentiment can
                                                  hardly get mixed into the situation if you do. <pb xml:id="d1e2496" n="108" facs="acs0000005-01-125"/>

                                                  to break off this hideous sort of compromise you
                                                  are living in. What you are doing insults God, and
                                                  maddens men who see it. Think what it is to endure
                                                  and to act as you do! I ask you what right you
                                                  have to let him play at husband with you? You
                                                  know <emph xml:id="d1e2571" rendition="#i">he</emph> has no right; why
                                                  should you have? Would you let him try force to
                                                  detain you if your mind were made up? You are
                                                  doing as great a wrong as that would be, if you
                                                  stay of your own accord. Who could blame you if
                                                  you went? Who can help blaming you now? I say
                                                  you cannot live with him always. If I thought you
                                                  could, could I think you incapable of baseness?
                                                  and you know, I am certain you do in your inmost
                                                  heart know, that you have shown me by clear proof

                                                  when I thought I could have worn it if I had
                                                  picked it up at your feet. The recollection makes
                                                  me half mad with shame. To have conceived of a
                                                  possible falsehood in your face is degradation
                                                  enough for me. Now that you have set me right (and
                                                  I would give my life to show you how much more I
                                                  have loved you ever since) I come to ask you to be
                                                  quite brave. Only that. I implore you now to go
                                                  without disguise at all. You cannot speak falsely,
                                                  I know; but to be silent is of itself a sort of
                                                  pretence. Speak, for Heaven’s sake, that all who
                                                  ever hear of you may adore you as I shall. Think
                                                  of the divine appeal against wrong and all
                                                  falsehood that you will be making!—a protest that
                                                  the very meanest must be moved and transformed by.
                                                  It is so easy to do, and so noble. Say why you go,
                                                  and then go at once. Put it before your brother.
                                                  Go straight to him when you leave the hateful
                                                  house you are in. He is very young, I know, but he
                                                  must see the greatness of what you do. Perhaps one
                                                  never sees how grand such things are—never
                                                  appreciates the reality of their greatness—better
                                                  than one does at his age. I think boys see right

                                                  not at all. I am neither oppressed nor passionate.
                                                  I don’t want delivering in the least. One would

                                                  Even if I were, how could you get me off? We are

                                                  day since, in de Blamont’s last book. I mean to

                                                  will be the ruin of. It feeds on the knight rather
                                                  than his lady. Do you pass by. Be my friend in a

                                                  something better than I can make my life now. I

                                                  does at first sight look just. But is this right
                                                  in your eyes, to have cut your own share out of
                                                  the world in this fashion? But what sort of
                                                  happiness, then, is this that you have caught hold
                                                  of? The fairest, joyfullest, needfullest thing
                                                  created is fire; and the fist that closes on it
                                                  burns. Let go, I counsel you, the bread of cunning
                                                  and violence, the sweet sources of treason and
                                                  self-seeking; there are worse ends than the death
                                                  of want. A soul poisoned is worse off than a
                                                  starved soul.” </p>

                                                  were to break up. Is Lord Cheyne tired of the

                                                  more to say. You speak so uncertainly of “having

                                                  all our hopes and recollections, and change the
                                                  whole look of life for me. I do not suppose you
                                                  have more regard for me than for any other kinsman
                                                  or chance friend. And I do not appeal to you on
                                                  the score of my own feeling. You are no coward to
                                                  be afraid of words, or of harmless things—I can
                                                  say safely, that if I could die to save you
                                                  trouble or suffering I should thank God. I love

                                                  you; all that does not seems done in play, or to
                                                  get the time through. But I am not going to plead
                                                  with you on this ground. I ask nothing of you; if
                                                  you were to die to-night I should still have had
                                                  more than my fair share of luck in life. If I am
                                                  to see you again, I can only be as glad of it as I
                                                  am now, when I think of you. I cannot understand

                                                  support and refresh. I was to say whether she were
                                                  right or not. To Mr. Radworth she could not turn

                                                  tenderly secure. I did think it was all over with
                                                  some of you, but found rapid relief. She put it to
                                                  me; was she to notice it? Was she to try to bring

                                                  quietly. She wound up with an intimation that I
                                                  was thus taken into confidence in order to give me
                                                  a just and clear idea of <emph xml:id="d1e2850" rendition="#i">her</emph> conduct and position; this she owed to

                                                  as little of your folly as she could avoid. Of

                                                  me. I, as arbitress, must decide, on receiving
                                                  such an appeal from her, backed by such proofs,
                                                  that she had gone on splendidly—was worthy of all
                                                  manner of praise—and that you, as a crazy boy in
                                                  the “salad days” of sentiment, were alone
                                                  blameworthy. Now, frankly, do you believe she had

                                                  was not such a fool as to appeal to me in a vague

                                                  mine as to that, and your mother’s too. I wish I

                                                  shame as I do now, and shall while you stay.
                                                  Promise you will not try to see me. I wonder if
                                                  God will be satisfied, supposing you never do see
                                                  me again? I shall have tried to be good. I think

                                                  quite broken; it is miserable to see her. She sits
                                                  for whole hours in her own room; I did hope at

                                                  but that comfort, I fear greatly, she is not yet
                                                  capable of feeling. She looks quite like death. I
                                                  suggested she should go into the room where he is
                                                  lying, and take her last look of him, but she
                                                  turned absolutely whiter than she was, shuddered,
                                                  and seemed quite sick. My brother is hardly less
                                                  overcome. On a servant addressing him yesterday by

                                                  way in a manner which I could not but regret. I am
                                                  certain he would sacrifice worlds to restore his

                                                  but him. Mr. Radworth offered to relieve him of

                                                  has undertaken to spare dear Amicia (Francis, I

                                                  refuses to share it. I cannot express to you the
                                                  admiration we all feel for his beautiful

                                                  than by another. We had decided, as you know, to
                                                  take Saturday last as the day of our projected
                                                  sail. Francis seemed curiously unwilling to go at
                                                  first, and it was only at poor Lord Cheyne’s
                                                  repeated request that he assented. Amicia was very
                                                  quiet, and I thought rather depressed—I have no
                                                  doubt in consequence of the sudden reaction from a
                                                  continued strain on her spirits. It was a very

                                                  summer plans. Quite suddenly, we heard ahead what
                                                  I fancied was the noise of the overfalls, and
                                                  began passing out of smooth water. I thought it
                                                  looked dangerous, but they <emph xml:id="d1e3110" rendition="#i">would</emph> put inshore. Feeling the waves run
                                                  rapidly a little higher and higher, I said
                                                  something to Amicia, who I knew was a bad sailor,
                                                  and as she scarcely answered, but lay back in the
                                                  boat, I feared the discomfort to her of rough
                                                  water had begun. I stooped forward, as well as I
                                                  remember, to sign to my husband to make Lord
                                                  Cheyne look at her. Ernest, in his nervous absent
                                                  way, failed to catch my meaning, and, in rising to
                                                  speak to me, was pitched forwards with a jerk, and
                                                  came full against Mr. Harewood, who was helping to

                                                  Amicia, and next second I saw poor Lord Cheyne in
                                                  the water. He caught at Francis, who was next him,

                                                  myself so as to see what anybody was doing, they
                                                  had got the body on board, and Francis and the
                                                  sailors and Ernest were trying to revive it.
                                                  Amicia, who was shaking dreadfully, kept hold of
                                                  her brother, chafing and kissing his face and
                                                  hands. How we ever got back God knows. Amicia
                                                  seemed quite stunned; she never so much as touched
                                                  her husband’s hand. When we came to get out, I
                                                  thought Francis and my husband would have had to
                                                  support her, but Mr. Radworth was <emph xml:id="d1e3128" rendition="#i">quite</emph> useless, and poor
                                                  Francis could not bear even to look at her misery.
                                                  So Mr. Harewood (who was really unfit to walk
                                                  himself) and one of the sailors had to carry her
                                                  up to the house. The funeral takes place
                                                  to-morrow; I trust my brother may be able to
                                                  attend, but really he seems at times perfectly

                                                  I have lost many people and many things I would
                                                  have given much to keep. I have repented and
                                                  lamented much that I have done, and more that has
                                                  happened to me—sometimes through my own fault. But

                                                  the analysis of regret are most idle things.

                                                 ? I have always hated condolence myself : where it
                                                  is anything, it is bad—helpless and senseless at
                                                  best. A grievous thing has happened; we can say no
                                                  more when all comment has been run through. To us
                                                  for some time—I say to us, callous as you are now

                                                  greater than they are. You have the worst of it.
                                                  Nevertheless, it is not the end of all things. The

                                                  I have now to do), I prefer things of the cold

                                                  either pious or tender, usually leave a sickly

                                                  themselves cannot be supported. Those who say they

                                                  was a touch of truth in my shreds of pagan
                                                  consolation. Stoicism is not an exploded system of
                                                  faith. It may be available still when resignation
                                                  in the modern sense breaks down. Resign yourself
                                                  by all means to the unavoidable; take patiently
                                                  what will come; refuse yourself the relaxation of
                                                  complaint. Have as little as you can to do with
                                                  fear, or repentance, or retrospection of any kind.

                                                  endurance of things that are is in any way a
                                                  sacrifice of Christian resignation offered to the
                                                  supreme powers. That is the unhealthy side of
                                                  patience; the fortitude of the feeble. Be content

                                                  submission. For, indeed, submission without
                                                  compulsion can never be anything but the vicious
                                                  virtue of sluggards. We submit because we must,
                                                  and had better not flatter ourselves with the
                                                  fancy that we submit out of goodness. If we could
                                                  fight our fate we all would. It is not the desire
                                                  to resist that we fail in, but the means; we have
                                                  no fighting material. It would not be rebellion,
                                                  but pure idiocy or lunacy, for us to begin

                                                  on the other hand, that is no reason why we should
                                                  grovel and blubber. It is a child’s game to play
                                                  at making a virtue of necessity. I say that if we
                                                  could rebel against what happens to us we would
                                                  rebel. Christian or heathen, no man would really
                                                  submit to sorrow if he could help it. Neither you

                                                  serious fighting; because they cannot struggle,
                                                  they say and believe they would not if they could;

                                                  very account need we try to impair them. Because

                                                  sober courage ends in that. Do, in Heaven’s name,
                                                  try to keep free of false hopes and feeble fears.
                                                  Face things as they are; think for yourself when
                                                  you think of life and death, joy and sorrow, right
                                                  and wrong. These things are dark by the nature of
                                                  them; it is useless saying they can be lit up by a

                                                  years of one’s life the time comes for speaking
                                                  out, if one will see it—these are matters I seldom
                                                  think over and never talk about, wishing to keep
                                                  my head and eyes clear. But my mind was made up,
                                                  if I did write to you, to keep back nothing I had
                                                  to say, and affect nothing I had not to say. You
                                                  are worth counsel and help, such as I can give;
                                                  the occasion, too, is worth open and truthful
                                                  speech. I do not pray that you may have strength
                                                  sent you; you must take your own share of work and
                                                  endurance; you have to make your strength for
                                                  yourself. I say again, time will help you, and we
                                                  should survive this among other lamentable things.
                                                  But for me, now that I have said my say and prayed
                                                  my prayers over the dead, I shall not preach on
                                                  this text again. What my love and thought for you
                                                  can do in the way of honest help has been done. If

                                                  sorrow, you will not ask it of me. Suppose I were

                                                  and look for as to these matters. I shall never

                                                  or by means of your sister. We know you will do
                                                  all you can in the best possible way; and she is
                                                  not yet well enough to bear worry. I fear, indeed,
                                                  that she has more to bear physically than we had
                                                  thought of. She keeps getting daily more white and
                                                  wretched, and we hardly know how to handle her.
                                                  When she arrived, she had a sort of nervous look
                                                  of strength, which begins now to fail her
                                                  completely; spoke little, except to me, but fed
                                                  and slept like a <emph xml:id="d1e3279" rendition="#i">rationally</emph> afflicted person. Now I see her
                                                  get purplish about the eyes, and her cheeks going
                                                  in perceptibly. It will take years to set her
                                                  straight if this is to go on. She is past all
                                                  medicine of mine. I dare say she will begin to
                                                  develope a spiritual tendency—she reads <pb xml:id="d1e3282" n="160" facs="acs0000005-01-177"/>

                                                  far too young to be a widow. That grey and cynical
                                                  condition of life sits well only upon shoulders of
                                                  thirty or forty. She is between shadow and sun, in
                                                  the dampest place there is. Mist and dew begin to
                                                  tell upon her brain : there is the stuff of a
                                                  conversion in her just now. I tell you this
                                                  because you have known her so well, and were such
                                                  good friends with her that you will be able to
                                                  take my meaning. I am sure you do want to hear,
                                                  and sincerely wish all things right with her
                                                  again. I hope they may be in time—we must take
                                                  them as they are now. Meantime, it is piteous
                                                  enough to see her. She comes daily to sit with me
                                                  for hours, and has a way of looking up and sighing
                                                  between whiles which is grievous to me. Again, at
                                                  times, I seem to have glimpses of some avowal or
                                                  appeal risen almost to her lips, and as suddenly
                                                  resigned. Her words have tears in them somehow,
                                                  even when she talks <emph xml:id="d1e3290" rendition="#i">peaceably</emph>. I had no suspicion of so deep or
                                                  keen a regard on her part. Our poor Edmund can
                                                  hardly have given her as much, one would say. But
                                                  who knows what he had in him? He was strange
                                                  always, with his gentle cold manner, and had rare
                                                  qualities. “I forget things,” she said one day on

                                                  have to marry, but you are full young as yet. I
                                                  should like to see what the house will hold in ten
                                                  years’ time, but do not much expect the luck.
                                                  Early deaths age people who hear of them. I feel
                                                  the greyer for this month’s work. They tell me you
                                                  have had Captain Harewood to help you in settling
                                                  down and summing-up. As he was, in a manner, your
                                                  guardian for a year or two after the death of your
                                                  father, I suppose he is the man for such work. I
                                                  believe he had always a good clear head and
                                                  practical wit. That wretched boy of his doubtless
                                                  lost his chance of inheriting it through my fault.
                                                  We came in there and spoilt the blood. I fancy you
                                                  have something of the same good gift. It is one I
                                                  have always coveted, and always failed of, that
                                                  ready and steady capacity for decisive work. Your
                                                  mother was a godsend to our family—we never had

                                                  vacuous verbose talk; he was nearly as
                                                  long-breathed, and as vague in his chatter, as I
                                                  am. Not such a thorn in the flesh of
                                                  correspondents, though, I imagine. I hear Reginald
                                                  is with his father at Plessey. The place is just
                                                  endurable in these hot months, but always gives me
                                                  a notion of thawing-time and webbed feet. It is
                                                  vexatious, not being able to send for the boy
                                                  here. Amy would be all the better for him; but of
                                                  course it is past looking for. She talks of him
                                                  now and then in a very tender and grateful way.”
                                                  Redgie was very good; I wonder what his wife will
                                                  be?” she said, once. There was no chance of such
                                                  luck for him in sight, I suggested; but she turned
                                                  to me with singular eyes, and said, “I should like
                                                  her if she would marry him soon.” She has a

                                                  Her husband never would sit for one, I recollect.
                                                  It seems Redgie was useful when nobody else could
                                                  have done much good. Those few days were hideous.
                                                  I never shall forget that white dried face of
                                                  hers, and the heavy look of all her limbs. Poor
                                                  child, I had to talk her into tears. She had the
                                                  ways of old people for some time after. Even now
                                                  she is bad enough; worse, as I told you, in some

                                                  help for it, you know. She would have had more to
                                                  bear at Lidcombe; and you will soon fit well into
                                                  the old place. Very fond of it she certainly was,
                                                  and some day, perhaps, I may take her over to see
                                                  you. That will be years hence. Your wife must be
                                                  good to the dowagers—I dare say she will. It will
                                                  be curious to meet there anyhow. One thing is a
                                                  pity, that Amicia can never have a child to keep
                                                  her company; for I think she can hardly marry
                                                  again, young as she is. A daughter would have done
                                                  you no harm, and left her with one side of life
                                                  filled up—she would have made a perfect mother. I
                                                  used to think she had much of the social type of
                                                  Englishwoman. It is such a broken-up sort of life
                                                  that one anticipates for her. And there was such a
                                                  tender eager delight in affection, such a soft and
                                                  warm spirit, such pure pleasure in being and doing
                                                  good—it is the most delicious nature I know. But

                                                  might have got on; now it is unbearable. There is

                                                  to be got through still. I go about the place like
                                                  a thief, and people throw the title in my face
                                                  like a buffet at every turn. And I keep thinking
                                                  of Amicia; her rooms have the sound of her in
                                                  them. I went down to the lake at sunset and took a
                                                  pull by myself. The noise of the water running off
                                                  and drawing under was like some one that sobs and
                                                  chokes. I went home out of all temper with things.
                                                  And there was a letter waiting from Aunt Midhurst
                                                  that would have made one half mad at the best of
                                                  times. She is right to strike if she pleases; but
                                                  her sort of talk hits hard. I felt hot and sick
                                                  with the sense of meanness when I had done. These

                                                  gives news of Amicia that would kill one to think
                                                  of, if thought did kill; mixes allusions in a way
                                                  that she only could have the heart to do. I

                                                  has. And there is nothing one can say in reply to
                                                  her. It is horrid to lie at her mercy as we do.
                                                  Their life in that house must be intolerable. I
                                                  can see Amy sitting silent under her eyes and
                                                  talk; sick and silent, without crying, like a

                                                  one else was under torture. I know so well by

                                                  and pity; divided from herself; beaten and broken
                                                  down and tired out. If she were to go mad I should
                                                  know why. And I cannot come near her, and you know
                                                  how I love her. I would kill myself to save her
                                                  pain, and I know she is in pain hourly, and I sit
                                                  here where she used to be. If I had never been
                                                  born at all she would have been happy enough with
                                                  her husband alive. I tell you, God knows how good
                                                  she was to him. If only one of their people here
                                                  would insult me, I should be thankful. But the
                                                  place seems to accept me, and they tolerate a new
                                                  face; I did think some one would show vexation or

                                                  day when Redgie Harewood came over with his
                                                  father; he did seem to think I had no business
                                                  here, and I never liked him so well. You recollect
                                                  how angry it made you. People ought to remember. I
                                                  was glad he would not stay in the house. That was
                                                  the only time any one has treated me as I want to
                                                  be treated. I shall come and stay with you if you
                                                  will have me. I cannot go about yet, and I hate
                                                  every comer of this house. When I ride I do
                                                  literally feel now and then tempted to try and get
                                                  thrown. Last winter we were all here together, and
                                                  she used to sing at this time in this room. The
                                                  voice and the sound of her dress come and go in my
                                                  hearing. I see her face and all her hair glitter
                                                  and vibrate as she keeps singing. Her hands and
                                                  her throat go up and down, and her eyes turn and
                                                  shine. Then she leaves off playing and comes to
                                                  me, and I cannot see her near enough; but I feel
                                                  her hands touch me, and hear her crying. I can do
                                                  nothing but dream in this way. I want my life and

                                                  must be unhappier than I am; she is so much

                                                  sister’s: the Radworths have asked him for some
                                                  time. I am also pressed to go, but I hardly like
                                                  being with him. Unfair, I suppose, but reasonable
                                                  when one thinks of it. He is a good deal pulled
                                                  down, and makes very little of his succession :
                                                  asks after you always, and seems rather to cling
                                                  to company. All the legal work is over; and I hope
                                                  you will not be bothered with any more letters. If

                                                  chance of my getting to work after all. They want
                                                  to diplomatize me : I am to have some
                                                  secretaryship or other under Lord Fotherington. If

                                                  Frank, the Radworths say. I have seen the
                                                  daughter, and she is admirable; the most perfect
                                                  figure, and hair like the purple of a heartsease;
                                                  her features are rather too like a little cat’s
                                                  for me; she is white and supple and soft, and I
                                                  suppose could sparkle and scratch if one rubbed up
                                                  her fur when the weather was getting electric.
                                                  Clara thinks her figure must be an English
                                                  inheritance: she is hardly over seventeen. They do

                                                  would push the match if she could on his account.

                                                  once had some inscription, which my grandfather
                                                  got rubbed out. He was a fastish sort of fellow
                                                  evidently, and rather a trump; he had some

                                                  show his face at Court afterwards. The old account
                                                  was that he lost heart after six months’ suit, and
                                                  killed himself for love of her: but the truth

                                                  and fell seriously in love with his rhymes and his

                                                  version) let him in at a wrong hour. Then, in the
                                                  late night, she went to Lord Cheyne and roused him
                                                  out of sleep, bidding him come now and be judge
                                                  between her and all the world. So he got up and
                                                  followed (in no end of a maze one would think),
                                                  and she brought him to a room where her lover was
                                                  lying asleep with his sword unfastened. Then she
                                                  said,—if he believed her good and honest, let him
                                                  strike a stroke for her and kill this fellow. And
                                                  the man held off (you should have heard your uncle

                                                  eyes caught fire, and her hand beat up and down);
                                                  he stood back and had pity on him, for he was so
                                                  noble to look at, and had such a boy’s face as he
                                                  lay sleeping along. But she bade him do her right,
                                                  and that did he, though it were with tears. For
                                                  the lover had hired that night a gentlewoman of
                                                  hers to betray her into his hands before it was
                                                  yet day; and she had just got wind of the device.

                                                  him stand up there and fight, and before the poor

                                                  the first pass under the heart. Then he took his

                                                  sprinkle the blood over his face. And the fellow
                                                  just threw up his eyes and winced as she wetted

                                                  bitter thing upon earth,” and so died. After that
                                                  she was held in great honour, and most of all by
                                                  her old suitor, Sir Edmund, who became friends
                                                  with her husband till the civil war, when they
                                                  took up separate sides, and people believed that
                                                  Brackley (who was of the Parliament party) killed

                                                  troopers, at all events, did, if he missed. The
                                                  story goes, too, that Cheyne lived to get at the
                                                  truth about his wife by means of her servant, and
                                                  “never had any great joy of his life afterwards.”

                                                  and preserved leaves; it reads like opening an old

                                                  there is a kind of serious twang in it here and
                                                  there, as if the man did care to mean something. I
                                                  suppose he didn’t mind, and liked his life the
                                                  better on account of her; would have gone on all
                                                  the same if he had known; fellows do get to be
                                                  such fools. I don’t think I should have cared much

                                                  too good to let the world be very good to her.
                                                  Tears and brilliant light mixed in her eyes when
                                                  she talked of that bit of story: the beautifullest
                                                  pity and anger and passionate compassion. She
                                                  might have kept <foreign xml:id="d1e3654" rendition="#i" xml:lang="fre">sans reproche</foreign> on her

                                                  I believe she could do anything great. She wanted
                                                  to be at Naples last year; would have outdone
                                                  Madame Mario in that splendid labour of hers. She
                                                  says if she were not in mourning already she would
                                                  put on deeper black for Cavour now; I told her
                                                  not. If she had been born an Italian, and had the
                                                  chance given her, she would have gone into battle
                                                  as gladly as the best men. That Venice visit last
                                                  year set the stamp on it. I never saw her so
                                                  nearly letting tears really fall as when she
                                                  quoted that about the “piteous ruinous beauty of

                                                  over like a sleepy sick child. I should not wonder

                                                  the amiable Octave, is not very like that
                                                  exquisite and infamous old father. Only I should

                                                  I doubt now if he ever will do any; but if he gets

                                                  Cheyne has time and room to beat about in, and
                                                  choose from right or left. Now Redgie, I begin to
                                                  believe, will have to marry before long. It would
                                                  be something to keep him out of absurdities. We
                                                  know too well what a head it is when any windmill
                                                  is set spinning inside it. And, without irony, I
                                                  am convinced Madame de Rochelaurier must have a
                                                  real kindly feeling about him. She was out of her
                                                  depth in love with your father in 1825, and Redgie
                                                  now and then reminds me a little of him; Frank is
                                                  placider, and not quite such a handsome fellow as
                                                  my brother used to be. It is so like her to come

                                                  ten years younger than Octave de Saverny. Redgie’s

                                                  you to tell me honestly how you look at it. To me
                                                  it seems he might brush about the world a little
                                                  more before he begins marrying. Only this instant
                                                  come of age, you know. The attachment might be a
                                                  good thing enough for him. Mademoiselle Philomène
                                                  I suppose must be clever; there is no reason to

                                                  vicomte’s flaccidity of head and tongue. Very

                                                  (curious for her) of late years, and has doubtless
                                                  undertaken to convert Reginald to sane views, and
                                                  weed out his heresies and democracies. I should

                                                  suggestion as an act of an insolent and rebellious
                                                  nature. I know the construction to which your
                                                  conduct towards your cousin has not unnaturally
                                                  exposed you; and you know that I know it. Upon her
                                                  and upon yourself your inexcusable and puerile
                                                  behaviour has already drawn down remark and
                                                  reproach. I am resolved, and I intend that you
                                                  shall remember I am, to put an end to this. I have
                                                  come upon a letter from your grandmother, dated
                                                  some time back—I think before the miserable
                                                  catastrophe in which you were mixed up at
                                                  Portsmouth—bearing immediately in every line upon
                                                  this affair : and I have read it with attention.
                                                  Secrets of that kind you have no right to have or
                                                  to keep; and I have every right and reason to
                                                  investigate them. Another time, if you intend to
                                                  pursue a furtive line of action, you will do well
                                                  to make it a more cautious one : the letter I
                                                  speak of was left actually under my hand, not so
                                                  much as put away among other papers. Upon the
                                                  style of Lady Midhurst’s address to you I shall
                                                  not here remark; but you must expect, I should
                                                  think, to hear that my view of such things is far
                                                  enough from being the same as hers. Rightly or
                                                  wrongly, I consider the sort of relationship she

                                                  criminal and contemptible: and I cannot pretend to

                                                  seem to me to have written and acted childishly
                                                  indeed, but not the less sinfully. However, I am

                                                  and overlook. All restrictions placed around you

                                                  thus early chosen to discard. It is poor comfort
                                                  to reflect that, as far as I know, you have not as

                                                  laudable to indulge in. This can but be at best

                                                  self-restraint on your part. Without this I count
                                                  all fortuitous abstinence from sin worth very

                                                  unstable, luxurious, passionate, and indolent, you
                                                  set at naught all guidance, and never in your life
                                                  would let the simple noble sense of duty take hold
                                                  of you. At school you were incessantly under
                                                  punishment; at home you were constantly in
                                                  disgrace. Pain and degradation could not keep you
                                                  right; to disgrace the most frequent, to pain the
                                                  most severe, you opposed a deadly strength of
                                                  sloth and tacit vigour of rebellion. So your
                                                  boyhood passed; I have yet in my ear the remark of
                                                  one of your tutors—” Severity can do little for
                                                  the boy; indulgence, nothing.” What the upshot of

                                                  shame. Absolute inert idleness and wilful vanity,

                                                  not a man living for whom I entertain a more
                                                  heartfelt regard—I had well nigh said
                                                  reverence—than for Mr. Radworth. I verily believe
                                                  he has not a thing, humanly speaking, to be
                                                  ashamed of in looking back upon his past life.
                                                  Every hour, so to say, has had its share of noble
                                                  toil—and, therefore, also its share of immediate
                                                  reward. For these men work for the world’s sake,
                                                  not for their own: and from the world, not from
                                                  themselves, they do in time receive their full
                                                  wages. There is no more unsullied and unselfish

                                                  desire of my whole life as a possible thing to
                                                  fulfil. Even to you I dare not well hint at such a
                                                  hope as that; but you must now understand for good
                                                  how things are with me; if not that, then nothing.

                                                  Redgie Harewood to be a feint, and meant
                                                  spitefully. I think not; she has the passion of
                                                  intrigue and management still strong; likes
                                                  nothing so well, evidently, as the sense of power
                                                  to make and break matches, build schemes and
                                                  overset them. I should like to see Harewood
                                                  married, and peace again at Plessey; he is not a
                                                  bad fellow; and she was always fond of him. I will
                                                  say he earned that at Portsmouth, but I hate to
                                                  hear of his being able to write to her now, and
                                                  then see and think how much there is between us to
                                                  get over. If I could get at her by any way
                                                  possible, I could keep her up still—but I can
                                                  hardly see how he is to help her much. Then,
                                                  again, if he were to marry, they might see each
                                                  other; and in no end of ways it would be a good
                                                  thing for him. His idolatry is becoming a bore, if
                                                  not worse; you should find him an ideal to draw
                                                  his worship off you a little. I know so well now
                                                  how miserable it is to feel on a sudden the thing
                                                  turn serious, and have to fight it before one has
                                                  time to see how. If it were fair to tell you all I
                                                  have had to remember and regret only since this

                                                  Cheyne’s death, her gentle goodness would make her

                                                  really past writing at all. If I could fall to

                                                  brute, it would be only rational for me. I, who
                                                  have helped to hurt her, and would have set myself

                                                  nothing of her left it chafes me to breathe. I
                                                  know how sometimes somewhere she remembers and
                                                  misses things that she had got used to—little
                                                  chance things that were about her in her husband’s
                                                  time. A book or two of hers were left; you will
                                                  see them when you come; I cannot write, and cannot
                                                  send them without a word. I am more thoroughly
                                                  afraid of hearing from Lady M. again than I ever
                                                  was of anything on earth—no child could dread any
                                                  torture as I do that. It is quite clear, you know,
                                                  that they expect a confinement—in some months’

                                                  son! Only they will not say it; so I must stay

                                                  they will make things good to her. You need hardly
                                                  express anger about the poor aunt. Those two are
                                                  her children, and she always rather hated us for
                                                  their sakes. Indeed, as about Reginald, I am not
                                                  sure she is so far out of the way. You must see

                                                  may want to avoid the look of it. He is not the

                                                  two months ago he gave me the most incredible
                                                  blowing up—I suppose no fellow ever got such a
                                                  letter. So I just dropped into him by return of
                                                  post, and let the whole thing lie over. He chose
                                                  to pitch into her too, in the most offensive way.
                                                  Now I’m not going to behave like a sneak to her
                                                  because she is too good for them. She trusts me in

                                                  seeing a stone thrown at her. And she speaks to
                                                  him without wincing. I do think the courage of
                                                  women is something unknown. I should run twenty
                                                  times a day if I couldn’t fight. He brings her
                                                  specimens of things. You can’t conceive what a
                                                  voice and face and manner the fellow has. She lets
                                                  him talk about his symptoms. He tells me he wishes
                                                  he could eat what I can. It would be all very well
                                                  if he had anything great about him. I suppose
                                                  women can put up with men that have; but a mere

                                                  cannot go on. I found her yesterday by herself in
                                                  the library here, looking out references for him.
                                                  The man was by way of being ill upstairs. She
                                                  spoke to me with a sort of sad laugh in her eyes,
                                                  not smiling; and her brows winced, as they never
                                                  do for him, whatever he says. She is so gentle and

                                                  Then I began and told her she had no sort of right
                                                  to take it in that way, and she couldn’t expect

                                                  see him sit by her ought to be enough for a man
                                                  with eyes and a heart. I know you were a good deal
                                                  in love last year, but Miss Charnworth couldn’t
                                                  have put anybody into such a tender fever of pity
                                                  as this one puts me; you can’t be sorry for her;
                                                  and I don’t think you can absolutely worship
                                                  anything you are not a little sorry for. To have
                                                  to pity what is such a way above you, no one could
                                                  stand that. It gives one the wish to be hurt for
                                                  her. I think I should let him insult me and strike
                                                  me if she wanted it. Nothing hurts me now but the
                                                  look of her. She has sweet heavy eyes, like an
                                                  angel’s in some great strange pain; eyes without
                                                  fear or fault in them, which look out over coming
                                                  tears that never come. There is a sort of look
                                                  about her lips and under the eyelids as if some
                                                  sorrow had pressed there with his finger, out of

                                                  the mark. I believe she knew I wanted her to come
                                                  away. If there were only somewhere to take her to
                                                  and hide her, and let her live in her own way, out
                                                  of all their sight and reach, that would do for
                                                  me. I tell you, she took my hands sadly into hers
                                                  and never said a word, but looked sideways at the
                                                  floor, and gave a little beginning kind of sigh
                                                  twice; and I got mad. I don’t know how I prayed to
                                                  her to come then. But she turned on me with her
                                                  face trembling and shining, and eyes that looked
                                                  wet without crying, and made me stop. Then she
                                                  took the books and went out, and up to him. Do you
                                                  imagine I can be off and on, or play tricks with
                                                  my love, for such a woman as that? Because of my
                                                  father, perhaps, or Ernest Radworth? She has a
                                                  throat like pearl-colour, with flower-colour over
                                                  that; and a smell of blossom and honey in her
                                                  hair. No one on earth is so infinitely good as she
                                                  is. Her fingers leave a taste of violets on the
                                                  lips. She is greater in her mind and spirit than
                                                  men with great names. Only she never lets her
                                                  greatness of heart out in words. I don’t think now
                                                  that her eyes are hazel. She has in her the royal
                                                  scornful secret of a great silence. Her hair and

                                                  believe she is doing good somewhere with her
                                                  thoughts. She is a great angel, and has charge of
                                                  souls. She has clear thick eyebrows that grow well
                                                  down, coming full upon the upper lid, with no gap
                                                  such as there is above some women’s eyes before
                                                  you come to the brow. They have an inexplicable
                                                  beauty of meaning in them, and the shape of the
                                                  arch of them looks tender. She has charge of me
                                                  for one. I must have been a beast or a fool if
                                                  there had not been such a face as that in the
                                                  world. She has the texture and colour of
                                                  rose-leaves crushed deep into the palms of her
                                                  hands. She can forgive and understand and be angry
                                                  at the right time : things that women never can
                                                  do. You know Lady Midhurst is set dead against
                                                  her, and full of the most infernal prejudice. The
                                                  best of them are cruel and dull about each other.
                                                  I let out at her (Lady M., that is), one day when
                                                  we spoke of it, and she stopped me. “She is always
                                                  very good to you,” she said; which is true enough.
                                                  “You and your sister are her children, and she
                                                  always rather hated Frank and me for your sakes. I

                                                  that she is so far wrong about you. Once I could

                                                  unreasonable, of course, but she does not like me

                                                  knowing her. “Only there is one thing to be sorry
                                                  about: that hard pointed way of handling things

                                                  up the heart she has by inches.” Those words stuck
                                                  to me. “If she believed or felt more than she
                                                  does, her cleverness and kindness would work so
                                                  much better. As it is, one can never go to her for

                                                  now that I love as well. I want you to remember as
                                                  I do how good you were once. If I am ill it comes
                                                  of miserable thought. You talk of her
                                                  compassionate noble nature. Dearest, if she has
                                                  any mercy, let her show it and save you. It is
                                                  cruel to make people play with poison in this way.
                                                  I would not blame her for worlds. I want to thank
                                                  her and keep good friends, but she must not let
                                                  you run to ruin. Think what imaginable good end
                                                  can there be to this? I suppose she is infinitely
                                                  clever and brave, as you say, but how can she face
                                                  things <emph xml:id="d1e4196" rendition="#i">for you</emph>? Every one
                                                  would say the horridest things. Do you want shame
                                                  for her? It would break your life up at the
                                                  beginning. I have no right to accuse—should have
                                                  none anyhow—but one has always a right to be
                                                  sorry. I see you could not be happy even if all
                                                  were given up on both sides. Don’t let her give
                                                  all up. I dare say she might; and that of course
                                                  is braver than any treason. If you knew my own
                                                  great misery! Sometimes I feel the whole air hot
                                                  about me; I should like to cry and moan out loud,
                                                  or beat myself. I am not old, and if I live all my
                                                  time out I shall never feel as if my <pb xml:id="d1e4199" n="219" facs="acs0000005-01-236"/>

                                                  were very old, and gone foolish. I was false in
                                                  every word and thought I had. I cannot kill
                                                  myself, you see, even by writing it down. Thinking
                                                  of it only hurts, without doing harm; I want to be
                                                  done harm to. I never spoke to you at Portsmouth.
                                                  If you never did know, you see now. I thought you
                                                  all knew. I seemed to myself to have the eyes of a
                                                  woman who has been cheating and lying to some one
                                                  just dead. I was penitent enough to have had the
                                                  mark on me. It would be better than playing false,
                                                  to leave her husband. But then she takes you—your
                                                  life and all. I do think she must not be let. I
                                                  hate repeating what was said viciously; and God
                                                  knows I must not talk or think scandal: but Madame

                                                  things about her and M. de Saverny; it is no
                                                  unkindness of my grandmother’s. She does not like
                                                  Clara now, but she is clear of all that, quite.
                                                  And there were letters, certainly. Madame de
                                                  Rochelaurier said so; they were the cleverest she
                                                  ever saw, but not good to write. It was two or
                                                  three years ago; M. de Saverny let her see them.
                                                  It was base and wretched, and he keeps them. He is
                                                  a detestable man; but you cannot get over that. I

                                                  I am not fit to help. Still, whatever I am, I do
                                                  know there must be right and wrong somehow in the
                                                  world. You should not make so much misery. I don’t
                                                  mean as to the people nearest you both. On your

                                                  friend. I wish you might see her. She is so full
                                                  of the tenderest beautiful ways. I know what she
                                                  hears hurts her. She shows little, but she cried
                                                  when our grandmother gave her letters to read. You
                                                  might be so good to us, for we can never do

                                                  it. Because you need not have been so good, when
                                                  you were so beautiful that nothing you did could
                                                  set you off. But you know I loved you ages first.
                                                  When I was a boy, and got sight of you, I knew
                                                  stupidly somehow you were the best thing there
                                                  was. You were very perfect as a child; I know the
                                                  clear look of your temples under the hair; and the
                                                  fresh delicious tender girl’s hair drawn off and
                                                  made a crown with. I want to know what one was to
                                                  have done without that? I don’t think you cared
                                                  about me a year ago—not the least, my love that is
                                                  now. I had to play Palomydes to your Iseult a good

                                                  me. I thought there had been more in her than one

                                                  of beauty. I don’t want women to carry the

                                                  colour in it. A woman should keep to the deep
                                                  sweet dark, with such a noble silence of colour in

                                                  and a sense of its own, that wants no gilt setting
                                                  of sunbeams to throw out the secret beauty in it.

                                                  that last year my poor little plaything of a
                                                  sister and your brother were almost ready to
                                                  believe they knew what it was—as you hear children
                                                  say. They had the look and behaviour of a girl and
                                                  boy playing themselves into belief in their play.
                                                  And all the while we have drawn the lot and can
                                                  turn the prize over, toss and catch it in our
                                                  hands. All little loves are such poor food to keep
                                                  alive on: our great desire and delight—infinite

                                                  way we like. Your sort of walk and motion and way
                                                  of sitting has just made me think of the doves at
                                                  Venice settling in the square, as we shall see
                                                  them before summer. There is a head like you in
                                                  San Zanipolo; a portrait head in the right corner
                                                  of a picture of the Virgin crowned : we shall see
                                                  that. Only it has thick curled gold hair, like my
                                                  sister’s. You had that hair when you sat to
                                                  Carpaccio; you have had time to grow perfecter in
                                                  since. I can smell the sweetness of the sea when I
                                                  think of our journey. I like signing my name, now
                                                  it has to do with you. My name is a chattel of
                                                  yours, and yours a treasure of mine. Let it be

                                                  brother, by the production of a child—male. In

                                                  this in time. While there was any doubt as to the

                                                  all but say it was a game of counter-chances. That

                                                  is too good a knight to grudge the baby its birth.

                                                  might bracket his name with the poor father’s.

                                                  pleasure—she glitters and undulates at every sight

                                                  in the light of it. You see how lyrical one may

                                                  babies. I should have thought her the kind of

                                                  ceremonial diversion. She is the image of that
                                                  quivering rest which follows on long impassive
                                                  trouble, and the labour of days without
                                                  deeds—quiet, full of life, eager and at ease. I
                                                  imagine she has no memory or feeling left her from
                                                  the days that were before yesterday. She and the

                                                  not old or stupid enough to see, what duller eyes
                                                  could hardly have missed of, the use your

                                                  and terrible to think of. Cleverness, like

                                                  correspondence; had not other eyes been there
                                                  before mine, nothing, of course, could induce me

                                                  take it) has come down now to the common print.
                                                  Show him what the old friend really was to you,
                                                  and he will congeal at once. I don’t imagine you
                                                  ever meant actually to let him thaw and distil

                                                  you would no doubt always have checked him in
                                                  time—if he would always have let you. But then,
                                                  upon the whole, it is as well to have a weapon at
                                                  hand. I believe he has grown all but frantic of
                                                  late, and has wild notions of the future—amusing

                                                  medicines. I know, after he had taken them, he

                                                  laws broken and lives united. Still, I had rather
                                                  suppress and swamp altogether the
                                                  Saverny-Rochelaurier episode, and all that hangs

                                                  matter at all, if I can. There is a better way,
                                                  supposing you like to take it. Something you will
                                                  see must be done; suppose you do this. Write a

                                                  all this folly for good. Say he must leave off

                                                  time has to take none of plenty who were better. I
                                                  showed you, now some eighteen months since, when
                                                  it first appeared, I think, that most charming
                                                  song of <title rendition="#dq">Love and Age,</title> the one bit of verse that
                                                  I have liked well enough for years to dream even
                                                  of crying over; the sweetest, noblest piece of
                                                  simple sense and manly music, to my poor thinking,
                                                  that this age of turbulent metrical machinery has
                                                  ever turned out; and it, by the by, hardly belongs
                                                  to you. Your people have not the secret of such
                                                  clear pure language, such plain pellucid words and
                                                  justice of feeling. Since my first reading of it,
                                                  the cadences that open and close it come back
                                                  perpetually into my ears like the wash of water on
                                                  shingle up and down, when I think of times gone or
                                                  coming. I never coveted a verse till I read that
                                                  in <title rendition="#dq">Gryll Grange</title>; there is in it such an
                                                  exquisite absence of the wrong thing and presence
                                                  of the right thing throughout—just enough words

                                                  ours. But for poor Edmund’s accidental death,

                                                  and she has shown me some part of your letter. I
                                                  do not think we shall have any more trouble at
                                                  home. My brother-in-law knows nothing of it. She
                                                  has written I believe to Reginald; I must say she
                                                  was angry enough, but insists on no notice. If she
                                                  were ever to find home all but too comfortless to
                                                  put up with, I could not well wonder; she has
                                                  little there to look to or lean upon. We are out
                                                  of the fighting times, but if M. de Saverny or any
                                                  other man living were to try and make base use of
                                                  her kindness and innocence, I suppose no one could

                                                  think we may look for peace. She would have me
                                                  racked if she could, no doubt, but received me
                                                  smiling from the tips of her teeth outwards, and
                                                  with a soft dry pressure of the fingers. Not a
                                                  hint of anything kept back. Evidently, too, she
                                                  holds her brother well in leash. Frank pleased me:
                                                  he was courteous, quiet, without any sort of
                                                  affectation, dissembled or displayed. I gave him
                                                  sufficient accounts, and he was grateful; could
                                                  not have taken the position and played a rather
                                                  hard part more gracefully than he did. We said
                                                  little, and came away with all good speed. The
                                                  house is a grievous sort of place now, and likely
                                                  to stay so. I have no doubt she will set all her
                                                  wits to work and punish him for her failure. She
                                                  will hardly get up a serious affair again, or it
                                                  might be a charity to throw her some small animal

                                                  behind—some hint of professional reserve which
                                                  does not really change them, but does colour them;
                                                  something which fails of being a check on their
                                                  style, but is exquisitely serviceable as a sauce

                                                  young, poor, excitable, stupid, and
                                                  pleasant—infinite ages ago, when the country and I

                                                  years old. I should hardly have been taken aback
                                                  if my brothers had come in and we had set to
                                                  playing together like babies. To be face to face
                                                  with such a dead and buried bit of life as that

                                                  schooldays: a time that seemed farther off now
                                                  than the years before his birth. I can’t tell you
                                                  how odd it was to be thrown back into ’52 without
                                                  warning—worse than the proverbial middle of next
                                                  week. I will say for Redgie he was duly ashamed,
                                                  and never looked sillier in his boyish time than
                                                  when I took him to task. Clara, I told him, had,
                                                  as far as I knew, behaved excellently; but I
                                                  wanted to have facts. Dismissal was legible on him
                                                  all over; but the how I was bent on making out. So
                                                  in time I got to some fair guess at the manner of
                                                  her final stroke. It was sharp and direct. She
                                                  wrote not exactly after my dictation (which I
                                                  never thought she need do, or would), but simply
                                                  in the resolute sacrificial style. She forbade him
                                                  to answer; refused to read him, or reply if she
                                                  read; would never see him till all had blown over
                                                  for good. It seems she could not well deny that

                                                  effect, that she was in love with him. She is
                                                  quite capable of being upset by simple beauty if

                                                  he would be a fool and very nice-featured. It is
                                                  the supreme Platonic retribution—the Nemesis of
                                                  sentimental talent, which always clutches such
                                                  runners as she is before they turn the post. There
                                                  was a small grain of not dubious pathos in her
                                                  letter : she was fond enough of him to regret what
                                                  she did not quite care to fight for. What she told
                                                  him I don’t know, nor how she put it: I can guess,
                                                  though. She has done for his first love, at any

                                                  opinion of her. One may suppose she put him upon
                                                  honour, and made the best of herself. I should
                                                  guess, too, that she gave hints of what he might
                                                  do in the way of annoyance if he were not ready to

                                                  see would prick him on the chivalrous side, and he
                                                  would obey and hold his tongue and hand at once—as
                                                  he has done. Anyhow, the thing is well killed and

                                                  it. One can’t be such a blackguard as to try and
                                                  take it out of her for changing her mind. She was
                                                  quite right to think twice and do as she chose;
                                                  and the best I can do now is to keep off and not
                                                  get in her way.” Of course the boy talks as if the

                                                  for centuries, and their eyes were now meeting
                                                  across a bottomless pit of change. I shall not say
                                                  another word on the matter : all is as straight
                                                  and right as it need be, though I <emph xml:id="d1e4663" rendition="#i">know</emph> that only last month he

                                                  being one. And so our little bit of comedy slips
                                                  off the stage without noise, and the curtain laps
                                                  down over it. Lucky it never turned to the tearful
