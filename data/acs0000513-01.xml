PREFACE. 

These Essays, written at intervals during a space of seven 
years, are now reissued with no change beyond the correction of an occasional error, the addition of an occasional 
note, and the excision or modification of an occasional 
phrase or passage. To omit or to rewrite any part would 
be to forfeit the one daim which I should care to put up on 
their behalf; that they give frank and full expression to 
what were, at the time of writing, my sincere and deliberate 
opinions. Only where I have detected a positive error 
or suspected a possible injustice have I changed or cancelled a syllable. As I see no reason to suppress what I 
have no desire to recant, I have not allowed myself to 
strike out the rare allusions, which might otherwise have 
been erased, to such obscure and ephemeral names or 
matters as may be thought unworthy even of so slight a 
record as the notice here conferred on them. The one 
object which gives to this book whatever it may have of 
unity is the study of art in its imaginative aspects. I have 
desired above all things to avoid narrowness and dogmatism, and to say simply what I think or perceive to be 



viii PREFACE, 

the truth on such matters, and on such only, as I can 
claim at least to have studied with the devotion of years 
to the utmost of what ability was in me. The convictions 
expressed are in any case my own, and due to the inspiration of no party, no stranger, and no friend. My judgment has been guided wholly by my sense of the service 
or the disservice done to art by the works or the opinions 
on which I have taken occasion to remark. I have spoken 
but once or twice at the outside either of bad work 
or bad criticism, of folly or of falsehood, of ineptitude or 
of malignity \ my chief aim, as my chief pleasure, in all 
such studies as these has been rather to acknowledge and 
applaud what I found noble and precious than to scrutinize 
or to stigmatize what I might perceive to be worthless and 
base. It is not indeed alwa}^ possible to show cause for 
our admiration of great men and their great work, and not 
seem in passing to stigmatize by implication the base work 
or the baser comments on other men's work of those who 
hate and covet the greatness which they can neither injure 
nor attain, the glory which they can neither diminish nor 
endure ; to praise what is good in any kind is to dispraise 
what is bad, and every honom: done to men worthy of 
honour is an insult to men who are powerless to confer it 
and hopeless to receive. 

To any who may think it presumptuous for a labomrer 
in one field of art to express his opinion on work done in 
another field, for a student in one line of art to pass sentence on a student or it may be on a master in a different 
line, I can only say that I see no reason which should 



PREFACE, ix 

forbid such an one more than another to form or to utter 
the opinion which men impractised in any form of art 
have an undisputed privilege to hold and to express. It 
is certain that a man's judgment may be shaped and 
coloured by the lines of his own life and the laws of his 
own labour ; that a poet for example may be as bad a 
judge of painting as a painter may be of poetry, each man 
looking vainly in his neighbour's work for the qualities 
proper to his own ; but it does not follow that either must 
of necessity be fool enough to mispraise or to dispraise a 
poem or a picture for the presence or the absence of 
qualities foreign to its aim. I would ask for either artist 
no more than is conceded as an unquestionable right to 
critics who are clear from any charge of good or bad work 
done in any but the critical line of labour : I would submit 
that there is really no evident or apparent reason why he 
should be less competent than his fellows to appreciate 
the merit or demerit of wopk which lies out of the way of 
his own ambition or achievement A lifelong delight in 
the glories of an art which is not my own, quickened by 
the intercourse of many years with eminent artists of 
different and even of opposite schools, may have failed to 
make me a good critic of their art, but can hardly have 
left with me less right to judge or less faculty of judging 
than every writer on the subject is permitted to claim for 
himself. One thing at least the cultivation of this natural 
instinct or impulse of enjoyment can hardly have foiled 
to ensure. A student from without who enjoys all forms 
and phases of an aUen art as he respects all forms and 



X PREFACE. 

phases of his own will be unlikely to make himself the 
conscious or unconscious mouthpiece of a single school 
or a select coterie. So much I think may justly be 
claimed for this book ; that it is not a channel for the 
transmission of other men's views on art, a conduit for the 
diffusion of praise or blame derived from foreign sources 
or discoloured by personal feelings. Twice only have I 
had occasion to review some part of the work of two 
eminent poets whose friendship I had enjoyed from my 
early youth : a fact which in the opinion of certain writers 
is more than sufficient to disqualify me from passing any 
sentence on their work that may be worthy of a moment's 
> attention. The accident of personal intimacy, it should 

seem, deprives you of all right to express admiration of 
what you might allowably have found admirable in a 
stranger. I know not whether we are to infer that the 
one right which remains to a man in this sad case is the 
right of backbiting and belying; but it is certain that any 
indiscreet attempt to vindicate his right of praising what 
he f ' .ds to be praiseworthy will at once expose him to the 
risk of being classed among the members of a shadowy 
society which meets or does not meet for purposes of 
reciprocal adulation. In the present instance the fact of 
reciprocity might at first sight seem somewhat difficult to 
establish ; considering that neither the one nor the other 
of the poets whom, though my friends, I have aUowed 
m)rself to admire, and though their fellow-craftsman have 
permitted myself to praise, has ever published one sentence or one syllable of friendly or of adverse criticism 



PREFACE, xi 

on any work of mine. How then their opinion of it can 
be matter of public knowledge, or on what ground the 
damning charge of " mutual adniiration " can be sustained, 
it passes the modest range of my weak imagination to 
conceive. Nor can it figure to itself anything more pitiful 
and despicable than a society of authors, artists, or critics 
held together by a contract for the exchange of reciprocal 
flattery, except a society of the same kind whose bond of 
union should be a compact of detraction, a confederacy of 
malignities, an alliance for the defamation of men more 
honoured than its members. On the other hand, it may 
be reasonably assumed, or at least it may plausibly be 
allied, that a writer whose interest or whose admiration 
is confined to the works of a single school or the effects 
of a particular style in art can claim no higher place or 
worthier office than that of herald or interpreter to a special 
community of workmen. If, however, my critical writing 
should be found liable to this charge, it will at least be admitted that the circle which confines my interest and limits 
my admiration is a tolerably wide one. I have not imfrequently found myself accused of lax and undiscriminating 
indulgence in too catholic and uncritical a taste, too wide 
and erratic a range of inconsistent sympathies, by men 
whose ways of work lay so far apart that they seemed to 
me as unable to estimate each other aright as I to withhold from the work of either the tribute of my thanks, 
it is impossible, I have been told, that any man of fair 
culture and intelligence can sincerely and equally admire 
at the same time the leaders or the followers of such 



xii PREFACE. 

opposite schools in art or letters. That must in eflfect 
be a somewhat elastic definition which should comprise 
in one term all the subjects of my study or my praise, a 
somewhat irregular process which should reduce them all 
to one denomination, a somewhat vague watchword which 
should marshal them all under one standard. I think 
upon the whole that having now gathered together these 
divers waifs of tentative criticism I may leave the babblers 
and backbiters who prate of " mutual admiration " and 
the cant of a coterie absorbed in its own self-esteem and 
fettered by its own passwords, to the ultimate proof or 
disproof of simple fact and plain evidence. If I am indeed one of those unfortunates who can see nothing good 
outside their own sect of partisans, it will not be denied 
that the sect to which I belong must be singularly comprehensive ; nor will it be questioned that I am singularly 
fortunate in the variety and the eminence of my supposed 
allies. I would not be betrayed into any show of egotism 
or recrimination ; but I thought it best not to let these 
reprints go forth together for the first time on their own 
account without a word of remark on their object and 
their scope. They are here arranged according to scale 
and subject, with the date appended when necessary ; and 
have now but to show for themselves whether or not they 
can pretend to any more noticeable or more vital quality 
than that of sincere desire and studious efibrt to see the 
truth and speak it.

<p><hi rendition="#sc">Once</hi> only in my life 1 have seen the likeness of Victor 
Hugo's genius. Crossing over when a boy from Ostend, 
I had the fortune to be caught in midchannel by a 
thunderstorm strong enough to delay the packet some 
three good hours over the due time. About midnight the 
thundercloud was right overhead, fall of incessant sound 
and fire, lightening and darkening so 
rapidly that it seemed to have life, and a delight in its 
life. At the same hour the sky was clear to the west, and 
all along the sea-line there sprang and sank as to music a 
restless dance or chase of siunmer lightnings across the 
lower sky : a race and riot of lights, beautiful and rapid 
as a course of .shining Oceanides along the tremulous 
floor of the sea. Eastward at the same moment the 
space of clear sky was higher and wider, a splendid semicircle 
of too intense purity to be called blue ; it was of 
no colour nameable by man ; and midway in it between 
the storm and the sea hung the motionless full moon ; 
Artemis watching with a serene splendour of scorn the

battle of Titans and the revel of nymphs, from her stainless 
and Olympian summit of divine indifferent light 
Underneath and about us the sea was paved with flame ; 
the whole water trembled and hissed with phosphoric 
fire; even through the wind and thimder I could hear the 
crackling and sputtering of the water-sparks. In the 
same heaven and in the same hour there shone at once 
the three contrasted glories, golden and fiery and white, 
of moonlight ^d of the double lightnings, forked and 
sheet ; and under all this miraculous heaven lay a flaming 
floor of water. </p>

<p> That, in a most close and exact symbol, is the best 
possible definition I can give of Victor Hugo's genius. 
And the impression of that hour was upon me the impression 
of his mind ; physical, as it touched the nerves 
with a more vivid passion of pleasure than music or wine; 
spiritual, as it exalted the spirit with the senses and 
above them to the very svunmit of vision and delight 
It is no fiaintastic similitude, but an accurate likeness of 
two causes working to the same effect There is nothing 
but that delight like the delight given by some of his 
work. And it is because his recent book has not 
seldom given it me again, that I have anything here to 
say of it. </p> 

<p>It is a book to be rightly read, not by the lamplight 
of realism, but by the sunlight of his imagination reflected 
upon om^ Only so shall we see it as it is, much less 
understand it The beauty it has, and the meaning, are 
ideal ; and therefore cannot be impaired by any want of 
realism. Error and violation of likelihood or fact which 
would damn a work of Balzac's or of Thackeray's cannot 

<pb n="3"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'HOMME QUI RIT.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">3</fw> 

even lower or lessen the rank and value of a work like 
this. To put it away because it has not the great and 
precious qualities of their school, but those of a school 
quite different, is just as wise as it would be on the other 
hand to assault the fame of Bacon on the ground that he 
has not written in the manner of Shakespeare ; or 
Newton's, because he has not written like Milton. This 
premised, I shall leave the dissection of names and the 
anatomy of probabilities to the things of chatter and 
chuckle so well and scientifically defined long since by 
Mr. Charles Reade as <quote>" anonymuncules who go scribbling 
about ; "</quote> there is never any lack of them ; and it will not 
greatly hurt the master poet of an age that they should 
shriek and titter, cackle and hoot inaudibly behind his 
heel It is not every demigod who is vulnerable there.</p> 

<p>This book has in it, so to say, a certain elemental 
quality. It is great because it deals greatly with great 
emotions. It is a play played out not by human characters 
only ; wind and sea, thunder and moonlight, have their 
parts too to fill. Nor is this all ; for it is itself a thing 
like these things, living as it were an elemental life. It 
pierces and shakes the very roots of passion. It catches 
and bends the spirit as Pallas caught Achilles and bent 
him by the hair. Were it not so, this would be no child 
of the master's ; but so, as always, it is. Here too the 
birth-mark of the great race is visible.</p>

<p>It is not, whatever it may seem, a novel or a study, 
historical or social. What touches on life or manners 
we see to be accidental byplay as soon as we see what the 
book is indeed ; the story of the batde of a human spirit, 
first with Fate, then with the old three subordinate

enemies : the World, the Flesh, and the DeviL And 
here I will say where the flaw, as I think, lies ; for, 
like other great things, a great book may have a flaw. 
The Flesh and the Devil, Josiane and Barkilphedro, are 
perfect ; the World is drawn wrong. And the reason is 
not far to seek. We all brush daily against the Flesh 
and the Devil, we must all rub shoulders and shake 
hands with them, and they are always much the same at 
root, only stronger and weaker with this man than with 
that ; therefore it needs only the hand of a great poet to 
paint them gready, after their true and very likeness. 
But the World is multiform. To paint one aright of its 
many faces, you must have come close enough on that side 
to breathe the breath of its mouth and see by the light of 
its eyes. No accumulation of fact upon fact gleaned and 
laid up never so carefuUy will avail you instead. Titian 
himself cannot paint without colours. Here we have 
canvass and easel duly made ready, but the colours are 
not to be had. In other words, here are many curious 
and accurate details painfully studied and stored up for 
use, but unhappily it is not seldom for misuse. Here are 
many social facts rightly retailed and duly laid out side 
by side, but no likeness of social life. Here are the 
Mohocks of the day, for example, much as we find them 
in Swift ; here is often visible even a vexatious excess of 
labour in the research of small things ; useless, because 
the collector of them has never applied his spirit to the 
spirit of the time in which these small things played in 
passing their small parts. He cannot, because that time 
has no attraction for him on any one side to temper the 
repulsion he feels from another side of it Pure hate and 

<pb n="5"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'HOMME QUI RIT,</fw> <fw type="pageNum">5</fw>

scorn of an age or a people destroy the faculty of observation, 
much more of description, even in the historic 
mind ; what then will they do in the poetic ? Doubtless 
there has been, as doubtless there is now, much that is 
hateful and contemptible in social matters, English or 
other; much also, as certainly, that is admirable and 
thankworthy. Doubdess too at one time and another 
there has been more visible of evil and shameful than of 
noble and good. But there can never have been a time 
of unmixed good or evil ; and he only who has felt the 
pulse of an age can tell, us how fast or slow its heart 
really beat towards evil or towards good. A man who 
writes of a nation or a time, however bad and base in 
the main, without any love for it, cannot wrfte of it well. 
A great English poetess has admirably said that a poet's 
heart may be large enough to hold two nations. 

<note n="1" place="bottom">
I know not if it has been remarked how decisive a note of the 
English spirit there is in Moliere, a Frenchman of the French : an 
English current, as recognisable as indefinable, passing under and 
through the tide-stream of his genius. There is a more northern 
flavour mixed into his mind, a more northern tone interfiised, than 
into any other of the great French writers, Rabelais excepted. 
ViUon, for instance, in so many ways so like them both, is nothing 
if not Parisian. And if I am not wrong no third great Frenchman has 
ever found such acceptance and sympathy among Englishmen unimbued 
^nth the French spirit as Rabelais and Moliere. For 
them instmct breaks down the bar of ignorance. </note> 

Victor Hugo's, apart from its heroic love of man, a love matchless 
except by Shelley's, holds two nations especially 
close, two of the greatest ; it has often been said he is 
French and Spanish ; that is, he loves France and Spain, 
the spirit of them attracts his spirit ; but he does not love 
England. There are great Englishmen whom no man 

<pb n="6"/>
<fw type"pageNum">6</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

has praised more nobly than he : but the spirit of historic 
England has no attraction for his. Hence, far mor^ important 
than any passing errors of grotesque nomenclature or misplaced 
detail, the spiritual and ingrained 
error of the book, seen only from its social or historic 
side. We catch nowhere for a moment the note of 
English life in the reign of Anne.

<note n="1" place="bottom">
For one instance, if a court lady had indeed insulted Swift, 
she would certainly have had by way of answer something (in 
De Quincey's phrase) <quote>" too monstrously Swiftian for quotation ; "<quote/>
something so monstrous, that the Dean might thenceforth have held 
the next place to Gwynplaine in her heart.</note> 

Those for whom I write will know, and will see, that I do not write as a 
special pleader for a country or a class, as one who will 
see no spot in England or nobility. But indeed it is 
an abuse of words to say that England is governed or 
misgoverned by her aristocracy. A republican, studying 
where to strike, should read better the blazon on his 
enemy's shield. <q>" England,"</q> I have heard it said, <q>" is
not <q>'a despotism tempered by epigrams,'</q> but a plutocracy 
modified by accidents."</q> </p>


<p>Enough now of the flaws and failures in this work ; 
<q>"enough, with over-measure."</q> We have yet before us
the splendour of its depths and heights. Entering the 
depths first, we come upon the evil spirit of the place. 
Barkilphedro, who plays here the part of devil, is a 
bastard begotten by lago upon his sister, Madame de 
Merteuil : having something of both, but diminished and 
degraded ; wanting, for instance, the deep daemonic 
calm of their lifelong patience. He has too much inward 
heat of discontent, too much fever and fire, to 

<pb n="7"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'HOMME QUI RIT.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">7</fw>

know their perfect peace of spirit, the equable element of 
their souls, the quiet of mind in which they Hve and 
work out their work at leisure. He does not sin at rest : 
there is somewhat of fume and fret in his wickedness. 
Theirs is the peace of the devil, which passeth all understanding. 
He, though like them sinning for sin's sake 
and hating for the love of hatred, has yet a too distinct 
and positive quality of definable evil He is actually ungratefiil, 
envious, felse. Of them we cannot say that they 
are thus or thus ; in them there is a purity and simplicity 
of sin, which has no sensible components ; which cannot 
be resolved by analysis into this evil quality and that. 
Barkilphedro, as his maker says with profound humour, 
<quote>" has his faults."</quote> We fear that a sufficient bribe might 
even tempt him into virtue for a moment, seduce him to 
soil by a passing slip the virginity of vice. Nevertheless, 
as the evil spirit of envy rather than the devil absolute, 
he is a strong spirit and worth study. The few chapters, 
full of fiery eloquence and a passion bitter as blood, in 
which his evil soul is stripped and submitted to vivisection, 
contain, if read aright, the best commentary ever 
written on lago. We see now at last, what no scholiast 
on Shakespeare could show us, how the seed may be 
sown and watered which in season shall bring forth so 
black a blossom^ a poison so acrid and so sure. </p>

<p>In this poem as in the old pictures we see the serpent writhing, 
not fangless, under the foot of an angel, 
and in act tu bruise as of old the heel that bruises his 
head. Only this time' it is hardly an angel of light 
Unconscious of her office as another St Michael, the 
Angel of the Flesh treads under the unconquerable Devil. 

<pb n="8"/>

Seen but once in full, the naked glory of the Titaness 
irradiates all one side of the poem with excess and 
superflux of splendour. </p>

<p>
Among the fields and gardens, the mountain heights 
and hollows, of Victor Hugo's vast poetic kingdom, there 
are strange superb inmates, bird and beast of various fur 
and feather ; but as yet there was nothing like this. 
Balzac, working with other means, might have given us 
by dint of anxious anatomy some picture of the virgin 
harlot. A marvellous study we should have had, one to 
bum into the brain and brand the memory for ever ; 
but rather a thing to admire than desire. The magnetism 
of beauty, the effluence of attraction, he would not have 
given us. But now we have her from the hands of a 
poet as well as student, new-blown and actual as a 
gathered flower, in warm bloom of blood and breath, 
clothed with live colour, fair with significant flesh, 
passionately palpable. This we see flrst and feel, and 
after this the spirit. It is a strange beast that hides in 
this den of roses. Such have been however, and must be. 
<quote>" We are all a Httle mad, beginning with Venus."</quote> Her 
maker's definition is complete : <quote>" a possible Astarte 
latent in an actual Diana."</quote> She is not merely spotiess in 
body ; she is perverse, not unclean ; there is nothing of 
foulness in the mystic rage of her desire. She is indeed 
<quote>" stainless and shameless ; "</quote> to be unclean is common, 
and her <quote>" divine depravity "</quote> will touch nothing common 
or unclean. She has seven devils in her, and upon her 
not a fleck of filth. She has no more in common with 
the lewd low hirehngs of the baser school of realism 
than a creature of the brothel and the street has in 

<pb n="9"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'HOMME QUI RIT,</fw> <fw tyope="pageNum">9</fw> 

common with the Maenads who rent in sunder the living 
limbs of Orpheus. We seem to hear about her the beat 
and dash of the terrible timbrels, the music that 
./Eschylus set to verse, the music that made mad, the 
upper notes of the psalm shrill and strong as a sea-wind,

<p>
It is no vain vaunt of the modem master's that he 
has given us in another guise one of these iEschylean 
women, a monstrous goddess, whose tone of voice <quote>" gave 
a sort of Promethean grandeur to her furious and amorous 
words,"</quote> who had in her the tragic and Titanic passion of the 
women of the Eleusinian feasts <quote>" seeking the satyrs under 
the stars."</quote> And with all this fierce excess of imaginative 
colour and tragic intonation, the woman is modem and 
possible ; she might be now alive, and may be. Some of 
her words have the light of an apocalypse, the tone of a 
truth indubitable henceforth and sensible to aU. <quote>" You 
were not bom with that horrible laugh on your face, were 
you ? no ? It must be a penal mutilation. I do hope 
you have committed some crime. — No one has touched 
me, I give myself up to you as pure as burning fire, I see 
you do not believe me, but if you only knew how litde I 
care ! — Despise me, you that people despise. Degradation 
below degradation, what a pleasure ! the double 
flower of ignominy ! I am gathering it. Trample me

that. — Oh ! I should like to be with you in the evening, 
while they were playing music, each of us leaning back 
against the same cushion, imder the purple awning of a 
golden galley, in the midst of the infinite sweetnesses of 
the sea. Insult me. Beat me. Pay me. Treat me like 
a street-walker. I adore you." </quote> </p>

<p>The naturalism of all that is absolute ; you hear the 
words pant and ring. Some might doubt whether her 
wild citations of old stories that matched her case, her 
sudden fantastic allusions to these at the very height of 
her frenzy, were as natural : I think they are. The great 
poet had a right if it pleased him to give his modem 
Maenad the thought and the tongue of a Sappho with the 
place and the caprice of a Cleopatra. Such a pantheress 
might be such a poetess ; then between fancy and fury 
we should have our Bassarid complete, only with silk for 
fox-skin. And this might be ; for the type of spirit can 
hardly be rare in any luxurious age. Pervarsity is the 
fruit of weariness as weariness is the fruit of pleasure. 
Charles Baudelaire has often set that theme to mystic 
music, but in a minor key : his sweet and subtle lyrics 
were the prelude to this grand chorus of the master's. </p>

<p>We have seen the soft fierce play of the incessant 
siunmer lightnings, between the deep sky full of passing 
lights and dreams, and the deep sea full of the salt seed 
of life ; and among them Venus arising, the final and 
fatal flower of the mystic heaven and the ravenous sea* 
Looking now irom west to east, we may see the moon 
rise, a tender tear-blinded ;noon, worn thin and pure, 
ardent and transparent </p>

touches. We see Virgilia as clearly as Imogen ; we see 
Dea as clearly as Esmeralda. Yet Imogen pervades the 
action of <title>" Cymbeline,"</title> 
Virgilia hardly speaks in crossing 
the stage of <title>" Coriolanus."</title> It is not easy to write at all 
about the last chapters of the book ; something divine is 
there, impalpable and indefinable. I must steal the word 
I want; they are <quote>"written as if in star-fire and immortal 
tears."</quote> Or, to take Shakespeare's words after Carlyle's, 
they are <quote>" most dearly sweet and bitter."</quote> The pathos of 
Æschylus is no more like Dante's, Dante's no more like 
Shakespeare's, than any of these is like Hugo's. Every 
master of pathos has a key of his own to unlock the 
source of tears, or of that passionate and piteous pleasure 
which lies above and under the region of tears. Some, 
like Dante, condense the whole agony of a Hfe into one 
exquisite and bitter drop of distilled pain. Others, like 
Shakespeare, translate it pang by pang into a complete 
cadence and symphony of suffering. Between Lear and 
Ugolino the balance can never be struck. Charles Lamb, 
we may remember, spent hours on the debate with a 
friend who upheld Dante's way of work against Shakespeare's. 
On which side we are to range the greatest poet 
of our own age, there can be no moment of question. I 
am not sure that he has ever touched the keys of sorrow 
with siurer hand to deeper music than here. There is 
nothing in his work of a more heavenly kind; yet, 
or it may be because, every word has in it the vibration of 
earthly emotion ; but through it rather than 
above, there grows and pierces a note of divine tenderness, 
the very passion of pity that before this has made 
wise men mad. Even more than the pathos of this dose, 

<pb n="12"/>
<fw type="pageNum">12</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

its purity and exaltation are to be noted ; nothing of 
common is there, nothing of theatrical. And indeed it 
needed the supreme sweetness of Dea's reappearance, a 
figure translucent with divine death, a form of flesh that 
the light of heaven shines through more and more as the 
bodily veil wears thinner and consumes, to close with 
music and the luminous vision of a last comfort a book 
so full of the sound and shine of storm. With the 
clamour and horror yet in our ears of that raging eloquence 
in which the sufferer flings into the faces of prosperous 
men the very flame and hell-fire of his suffering, it needed 
no less than this to leave the mind exalted and reconciled. 
But this dew of heaven is enough to quench or allay the 
flames of any hell. There are words of a sweetness unsurpassable, 
as these : <quote xml:lang="fr">" Tout cela s'en va, et il n'y aura
plus de chansons."</quote> And upon all there dwells the 
measureless and nameless peace of night upon a still sea. 
To this quiet we have been led through all the thunder 
and tumult of things fatal, firom the tempestuous overture 
of storm and whirlwind ; from sea again to sea. There 
is a divine and terrible harmony in this chorus of the play, 
secretly and strangely sustained, yet so that on a full 
reading we feel it, though at first sight or hearing it must 
be missed. </p>

<p>Of the master's unequalled power upon natural things, 
upon the elements we call inanimate, knowing even less 
the laws of their life than of ours, there is happily no need, 
as surely there are no words, to speak. Part of this power 
we may recognise as due to the subtle and deep 
admixture of moral emotion and of human sentiment with 
the mysterious action and passion of nature. Thus in 

<pb n="13"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'HOMME QUI RIT.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">13</fw> 

<title xml:lang="fr">" Les Travailleurs de la Mer "</title>
the wind and the sea gain 
strength and depth from the human figure set to fight 
them ; firom the depth and strength of the incarnate spirit 
so doing and suffering. Thus in this book there is a new 
sense and a new sublimity added to the tempest by the 
remorse of men sinking at once under sin and storm, 
drowned under a double weight of deeds and waves. </p>

<p>Not even in that other book is the supreme mastery 
of nature, the lordship of the forces of things, more 
admirable and wonderfull than throughout the first part of 
this. He who could think to describe might think to 
rival it But of one point I cannot but take note ; there 
is nothing, even at the height of tragic horror, repellent, 
ugly, hateful. It has been said there is, and will be said 
again ; for how should there not be distorted eyes and 
envious tongues in the world ? Indeed a pieuvre is no 
pleasant playfellow, the <quote>" tree of man's making "</quote> bears a 
feariul finit, the monstrous maidenhood of Josiane is no 
sister to the starry virginity of Dea ; but how has the 
great poet handled these things ? The mutilation of a 
child's face is a thing unbearable for thought to rest on ; 
but have we not seen first the face of a heroic soul ? Far 
elsewhere than in the work of our sovereign poet must we 
look for the horror which art will have none of, which 
nature flings back with loathing in the bringer's face. If 
not, we of this time who love and serve his art should indeed 
be in a bad case. But upon this matter we cannot 
permit the blind and nameless leaders of the nameless 
blind to decide for us. Let the serious and candid 
student look again for himself and see. That <quote>" fight of 
the dead with the dark,"</quote> that swinging of carrion birds 

<pb n="14"/>
<fw type="pageNum">14</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

with the swing of the gibbeted carrion, might have been 
so done into words as to beget in us mere loathing ; but 
how is it done here? The mighty manner of Victor 
Hugo has given to this ghastly matter something even of 
a horrible charm, a shocking splendour of effect The 
rhythmic horror of the thing penetrates us not with loathing, 
but with a tragic awe and terror as at a real piece of 
the wind's work, an actual caprice of the night's, a portion 
of the tempest of things. So it is always ; handle what 
he may, the touch of a great poet will leave upon it a spell 
to consume and transmute whatever a weaker touch would 
leave in it of repulsive. </p>

<p>Whether or not we are now speaking of a great poet, 
of a name imperishable, is not a question which can be 
gravely deliberated. I have only to record my own poor 
conviction, based on some study and comparison of the 
men, that precisely as we now think of those judges who 
put Fletcher above Shakespeare, Cowley above Milton, 
the paid poets of Richelieu beside Comeille, and I know 
not whom beside Molière, will the future think of those 
judges who would place any poet of his age by the side 
of Victor Hugo. Nor has his age proved poor — it has 
rather been singularly rich — in men and in poets really 
and greatly admirable. But even had another done as 
well once and again as the master himself, who has done 
so well as much ? Had he done but half, had he done 
but a tenth of his actual work, his supremacy, being less 
incontestable, would no doubt have been less contested. 
A parsimonious poet calculates well for his own time. 
Had Victor Hugo granted us but one great play— say 
<title xml:lang="fr">"Marion de Lorme,"</title> but one great lyric work— say 

<pb n="15"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'HOMME QUI RIT.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">15</fw> 

<title xml:lang="fr">" Les Contemplations,"</title> but one great tragic story — say 
any one you please, the temptation to decry or denounce 
him by comparison would have been less ; for with the 
tribe of Barkilphedro the strength of this temptation grows 
with the growth of the benefit conferred. And very 
potent is that tribe in the world of men and of letters. </p>

<p>As for me, I am not careful to praise or dispraise by 
comparison at all. I am not curious to enquire what of 
apparent or of actual truth there may be in any charge 
brought against the doer of the greatest things done, the 
giver of the greatest gifts given among men in our times. 
Goethe found his way of work mechanical and theatrical ; 
Milton also lived to make oblique recantation of his early 
praise of Shakespeare ; we may, and should, wish this 
otherwise : yet none the less are they all great men. It 
may be there is perceptible in Victor Hugo something too 
much of positive intention, of prepense application, of 
composition and forethought : what if there were ? One 
question stands forth first and last ; is the work done good 
work and great, or not ? A lesser question is this ; these 
that we find to be feults, are they qualities separable fi-om 
the man's nature? could we have his work without them? 
If not, and if his work be great, what will it profit us to 
blame them or to regret ? First, at all events, let us have 
the sense to enjoy it and the grace to give thanks. What 
for example if there be in this book we have spoken of 
errors of language, errors historical or social ? Has it 
not throughout a mighty hold upon men and things, the 
godlike strength of grasp which only a great man can have 
of them? And for quiet power of hand, for scornful 
suieness of satiric truth, what can exceed his study of the 

<pb n="16"/>
<fw type="pageNum">16</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO.</fw> 

queen of England (Anne) ? Has it not been steeped in 
the tears and the fire of live emotion ? If the style be 
overcharged and overshining with bright sharp strokes and 
points, these are no fireworks of any mechanic's fashion : 
these are the phosphoric flashes of the sea-fire moving on 
the depth of the limitless and living sea. Enough, that 
the book is great and heroic, tender and strong ; full from 
end to end of divine and passionate love, of holy and 
ardent pity for men that suffer wrong at the hands of men ; 
full, not less, of lyric loveliness and lyric force ; and I for 
one am content to be simply glad and grateful : content 
in that simplicity of spirit to accept it as one more benefit 
at the. hands of the supreme singer now living among us 
the beautiful and lofty life of one loving the race of men 
he serves, and of them in all time to be beloved. </p>

By the light of that precious record, 
and by this light alone, can it be properly read. There 
all who will may see by what right even beyond the right 
of genius the greatest poet of his great nation speaks now 
to us as a prophet to his people : by what right of labour, 
by what right of sorrow, by what right of pity and of scorn, 
by what right of indignation and of love. None of those 
disciples who most honoured him in his time of banishment 
could have anticipated for their master a higher 
honour or a heavier suflfering than those nineteen years of 
exile ; but in his own country there was reserved for him 
a brighter crown of honour, with a deeper draught of 
suflfering. To defend Paris against Versailles and against 
itself, and to behold it wasted on the one hand with fire 
which was quenched on the other hand in blood : to cast 
from him the obloquy of men who refused to hear his

defence of Garibaldi for the oflfence of coming to their 
aid, and to pass at once from the clamour of the 
Assembly to the silence of sudden death, beside the 
corpse of a beloved son ; to offer shelter to his enemies, 
and to be hunted from that shelter himself : these were 
things he had yet to do and to endure. </p>

<p>The poem opens with a prelude at once prophetic and 
satiric, tender and wise and full of noble scorn and 
nobler pity ; the verse which sets a crown on the head 
of the people and a brand on the face of the mob is such 
as it is given but to one man in an age to write, and that 
by no means in every age. Then, for the first and fatal 
month of <date when="1870-08">August 1870</date>, we have a poem terrible as the 
occasion which called it forth, fit alike to serve as 
prologue to the poems of the months which follow or as an 
epilogue to the <title xml:lang="fr">" Châtiments "</title> which went before. That 
nothing after Sedan might be wanting to the fugitive 
assassin once elect of the party of Barabbas, the scourge 
of imperishable verse is added to the branding-iron of 
historic fact. </p>

<p>The poems of the siege at once demand and defy 
commentary ; they should be studied in their order as 
parts of one tragic symphony. From the overture which 
tells of the old glory of Germany before turning to France 
with a cry of inarticulate love, to the sad majestic epilogue 
which seals up the sorrowftil record of the days of 
capitulation, the various and continuous harmony flows 
forward through light and shadow, with bursts of thunder 
and tempest and interludes of sunshine and sweet air. 
In that last poem for February we see as it were the 
agony of faith ; before the sight of evil inseparable from

good, of good inextricable from evil, the rallying cry of 
hope seems for the moment, and only for the moment 
seems, to falter even on the lips which uttered that 
sovereign song of resurrection, great as the greatest old 
Hebrew psalm, which crowns and closes the awful roll 
of the <title xml:lang="fr">" Châtiments."</title> For that mighty hymn of a transcendant 
faith in the final conscience of the world called 
God, in the ultimate justice and universal vision of the

In this tragic range of poems reaching from September 
to March there is an echo of aU emotions in turn that the 
great spirit of a patriot and a poet could suffer and express 
by translation of suffering into song ; the bitter cry 
of invective and satire, the clear trumpet-call to defence, 
the triumphal wail for those who fell for France, the 
passionate sob of a son on the stricken bosom of a 
mother, the deep note of thought that slowly opens into 
flower of speech, and through all and after all the sweet 
unspeakable music of natural and simple love. After the 
voice which reproaches the priestlike soldier we hear the 
voice which rebukes the militant priest : and a fire as 
the fire of Juvenal is outshone by a light as the b'ght of 
Lucretius. In the verses addressed <quote>" to the Bishop who 
calls me Atheist,"</quote> satire is dissolved in aspiration, and 
the keenest edge of scorn is molten in the highest ardour

of worship. The necessity of perfect disbelief in the 
incredible and ignoble for every soul that would attain 
to perfect belief in the noble and credible was nevermore 
clearly expounded or more loftily proclaimed. The fiery 
love and faith of the patriot find again and ever again 
some firesh glory of speech, some new splendour of song, 
in which to array themselves for everlasting ; words of 
hatred and horror for the greed and ravin of the enemy
and his princes

In sharp and sweet contrast to these stand the poems 
of a finer excellence, such as the letter of <date when="01-10">January 10th</date> 
sent by balloon from the besieged city with its bright 
brave message of affection and confideifce, full of the 
clear light laughter of French heroism not less than of its 
high and fiery faith. But for perfect delight and strong 
charm of loveliness we return at each reading to the 
domestic poems as to the crowning splendour and wonder 
of this great book. All students have always known 
Victor Hugo for the supreme singer of childhood ; of its 
works and ways, its gladness and sadness, its earthly weakness 
and heavenly beauty, its indefinable attraction l)ring 
deeper than all reason can sound or all analysis resolve. 
Even after Shakespeare's portrait of Mamillius, and the 
divine cradle-songs of Blake, we are compelled to 
recognise in the living master the most perfect poet of 
little children. Circumstances have given to these present 

<pb n="24"/>
<fw type="pageNum">24</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

poems a colour and a pathos, a gentle gloiy and a 
luminous tenderness, which only such a framework of 
time and place could give. Out of the strong has come 
forth such sweetness, out of the lion's mouth such honey, 
as no smaller or weaker thing can breed. Assuredly, 
as the Master has said himself in that majestic prose 
poem inscribed with the name of Shakespeare, the 
mightiest mountains can outmatch even for flowers the 
valleys whose whole business is to rear them ; their 
blossoming ravines and hollows full of April can beat the 
meadows at their own trade; the strongest of singers 
are the sweetest, and no poet of the idyllic or elegiac 
kind can rival even on his own peculiar ground, for 
tender grace and delicacy of beauty, the most potent 
poets of a higher order, sovereigns of lyric and of tragic 
song. It is Æschylus, and not Euripides, who fills the 
bitter air of the Scythian ravine with music of wings and 
words more sweet than sleep to the weary, with notes of 
heavenly pity and love unsubduable by fear ; who shows 
us with one touch of terrible tenderness the maiden 
agony of Iphigenia, smiting with the piteous dart of her 
eye each one of the ministers of sacrifice, in dumb 
show as of a picture striving to speak to them ; who 
throws upon the most fearful scene in all tragedy a flash 
of pathos unspeakable, when Clytæmnestra bares before 
the sword of her son the bosom that suckled him as he 
slept. What Euripidean overflow of tears and words can 
be matched for its own special and much vaunted quality 
of tender and pathetic sweetness against such instances 
as these of the awfiil sweetness and intensity of the pathos 
of Æschylus ? what wailing outcry <quote>" in the measures of

a hired Cissian mourner"</quote> can be likened to these brief 
words that sting like tears of fire ? what milder note of 
the lesser gods of song has in it such penetrative and 
piercing gentleness as the softened speech of the thunderbearer ? 
Where, among the poets who have never gone 
up to the prophetic heights or down to the tragic depths 
of thought and passion, is there one who can put forth 
when he will verse of such sweet and simple perfection 
as the great tragic and prophetic poet of our own age ? 
These are some of the first verses inscribed to the baby 
grandchild whose pretty presence is ever and anon 
recalled to our mind's eye between the dark acts of the 
year-long tragedy.

<p>As in the look and action of a little child, so in this 
verse itself there is something of dim and divine pathos, 
sensible in the very joy of its beauty ; something which 
touches men not too much used to the melting mood 
with a smiling sense of tears, an inner pang of delight 
made up of compassion and adoration before that divine

child in a time of sickness the pathos is more direct and 
tangible ; more tender and exquisite than this it could 
f not be. Again, in January, we have a glimpse <quote>" between 
two bombardments "</quote> of the growing and changing charm 
of the newly weaned angel, now ambitious to feel its feet

of household intimacy with an actual kitten, and old

With the one eternal exception of Shakespeare, what other
poet has ever strewn the intervals of tragedy with blossoms 
of such breath and colour? The very verse seems a 
thing of flowerlike and childlike growth, the very body of 
the song a piece of living nature like any bud that bursts 
or young life that comes forth in spring. We are reminded 
of the interlude in Macbeth made by the prattle 
of Macduff's child between the scenes of incantation and 
of murder. Beside these the student will set in the high 
I, places of remembrance the lines on a shell falling where 
once were the Feuillantines — that garden of now 
immortal blossom, of unwithering flower and fruit undecaying,
 where the grey-haired Master was once a feirhaired child, 
 and watched beyond the flight of doves at 
sunrise the opening in heaven of the chaliced flower of 
dawn — ^in the same heaven where now blazes over his 
head the horrible efflorescence of the bursting Shell.

<p>After five months of siege comes a month of mourning, 
and after the general agony an individual anguish. , 
Before this we are silent ; only there rises once more in 
our ears the unforgotten music of the fourth book of the

the renewal of that august and awful sorrow. </p>

<p>Then come the two most terrible months of the whole 
hideous year ; the strange vision of that Commune in 
which heroes were josded by rufiians, and martyrs fell 
side by side with murderers ; the monstrous figure of that 
Assembly on whose head lies all the weight of the blood 
shed on either side, within the city as without; the 
spectral unspeakable aspect of that fratricidal agony, as of 
some Dantesque wrestle between devils and lost souls in 
helL Against the madness of the besieged as against the 
atrocity of the besiegers the voice of the greatest among 
Frenchmen was lifted up in vain. In vain he prophesied, 
when first a threat of murder was put forth against 
the hostages, of the murderous reprisals which a crime 
so senseless and so shameless must assuredly provoke. 
In vain he reclaimed for Paris, in the face of Versailles, 
the right of municipal self-government by her own 
council ; in vain rebuked the untimely and inopportune 
haste of Paris to revindicate this right for herself in a 
season of such unexampled calamity and peril. On the

<date when="04-23">23rd of April</date> he wrote from Brussels, where the care of 
his fatherless grandchildren for the time detained him, a 
letter to the <title rend="italics">Rappel</title>, suppressed in their deaf and bliiid 
insanity by men who would not hear and could not see ; 
in this letter he traced with the keen fidelity of science 
the disease to its head, and with the direct intelligence of 
simple reason tracked the torrent of civil war to its source ; 
to the action of the majority, inspired by the terror and 
ignorance which ere long were to impel them to the conception 
and perpetration of even greater crimes than they 
had already provoked from the ignorance and passion of 
their antagonists. Above all, his ^ithful and fearless 
voice was raised before both parties alike against the 
accursed principle of reprisals. Now as of old, as ever 
throughout his life of glory and of good, he called upon 
justice by her other name of mercy ; he claimed for all 
alike the equity of compassion ; he stood up to plead for 
all his enemies, for all the enemies of his cause — ^to 
repudiate for himself and his fellow-suflferers of past time 
the use of such means as had been used against themselves — 
of banishment, imprisonment, lifelong proscription, 
murder in the mass or in detail. But the plague was 
not so to be stayed ; and when the restored government 
had set itself steadily to outdo in cold blood the crimes of 
the conquered populace in its agony, the mighty voice 
which had appealed in vain against the assassins and 
incendiaries whose deeds had covered with just or unjust 
dishonoiu: the name of the fallen party, who had confused 
in the sight of Europe their own evil works with the 
noble dreams and deeds of better men, and sullied with 
the frimes of blood and fire the once sublime and stainless

name of <q>"commune"</q> — this same voice was heard to 
intercede for the outcasts of that party, to offer a refuge 
to fugitives from the grasp of a government yet guiltier of 
blood than theirs. This infamous crime had not long to 
wait for its reward ; a night attack on the house of the 
criminal with paving-stones and levers and threats of 
instant death. The year before, in answer to his appeal 
against invasion, certain bloodhounds of the press in 
Germany had raised such another yell as these curs in 
Belgium, bidding <quote>" hang the poet at the mast-head ; "</quote>
this time the cry was <quote rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">" À la lanierne ! "</quote>
Never was the sanguinary frenzy of the men of revolution, as exemplified 
in Victor Hugo, set off in stronger relief by the mild 
wisdom and moderation of the men of order, as exemplified
in his assailants. Moved by this consideration, 
the Belgian government naturally proceeded to expel the 
offender ; but with a remarkable want of logic omitted to 
offer the slightest reward to the brave men who had 
vindicated law and order by leading a forlorn hope 
against a fortress garrisoned by an old man, four women, 
and two children, one twenty months of age, one two years 
and a half. It is almost incredible that some months 
later the son of a minister, who had taken a leading part 
in this heroic work, was condemned to a fine of not less 
than four pounds sterling. Considering that once at 
least he or another of the crew did very nearly succeed 
in beating out the brains of the child in arms with a wellaimed 
flint, it is simply inexplicable that no mark of 
honour should have been conferred by royal or national 
gratitude on so daring a champion of law, so devoted a 
defender of social order against the horrors of imminent

anarchy. In a case of this pressing danger, this mortal 
peril, it is not every man who would have put himself 
forward at such risk to protect against a force so formidable 
the threatened safety of society ; not even the native 
land of these lion-hearted men can hope always to reproduce a 
breed of patriots ready to incur such hazards 
and undertake such feats as this in the sacred cause of 
their country. France has her Bayards and her Dantons, 
England her Sidneys and her Nelsons ; these are but 
common heroes, fit only to be classed with the heroes 
and patriots of old time, and such as their native soil 
might haply rear again at need ; but the most ardent and 
sanguine lover of his country in all Belgium can hardly 
hope that his fatherland will ever again bring forth a 
race of men worthy to be called the seed of such fathers 
as these; men capable of exploits unexampled in the 
annals of vulgar patriotism, and from which the bravest 
of those above cited would assuredly have drawn back. 
It is hard to imagine those heroes of other countries 
inspired with the courage requisite to make war upon 
5uch enemies and under such conditions as could not 
suffice to daunt or divert from their purpose the heroes 
of Brussels. </p>

<p>Thus, as once before from Jersey, was Victor Hugo 
now driven from Belgium by a government which in the 
year of general shame contrived to attain the supreme 
crown of disgrace, to gather the final flower of ignominy ; 
a distinction not easy to win from so many rivals in 
the infamous race; but theft and murder, under their 
magnified and multiplied forms of national robbery and 
civic massacre, are too common among a certain sort of

conquerors to be marked out for such especial notice as an 
act of this singular and admirable baseness. From all 
imclean things, from the mouths of the priesthood and 
the press, from the tongues that lap blood and the throats 
that vomit fialsehood, rose the cry of mockery and hatred ; 
if the preacher of peace and righteousness, the counsellor 
of justice and of mercy, were not a madman, he would 
be a ruffian ; but the punctilious equity of episcopal 
journals gave him the benefit of the doubt Yet for all 
this, as the poet found on leaving Brussels, it is not 
everybody who can impose the doom of exile ; to expulsion 
the foreigner may condemn you, to exile he 
cannot Exile is from the fatherland alone; a man's 
own country is the only one terrible to him who is cast out 
from it In words full of the beauty of a divine sorrow 
the exile of many years has set down the difference.</p>

<p>From Vianden as from Brussels he continued to 
fulfil the duty of intercessor ; to plead for the incendiary 
who could not read, for the terrible and pitiable woman 
dragged in triumph through the laughing and raging 
throngs of Versailles, dumb and bleeding, with foamflecked 
lips fast locked in bitterness of silence, in savage 
deafriess that nothing can move or shake, with the look 
as of one <quote>" aweary of the sun,"</quote> with a kind of fierce 
affright in her eyes. For all such his appeal is made to 
their slayers on the old sacred plea, <quote>" Forgive them ; for 
they know not what they do."</quote> Their wretchedness and 
their ignorance, their great want and their litde knowledge, 
left them conscious of all that they suffered, unconscious 
of all that they did.</p>

one stands up with the light of a great deed on it, relieved 
against the rest in a glory as of sunrise. It is the poem 
which places on everlasting record the heroism of a child 
of twelve, condemned to be shot after all his companions, 
who asked leave to go first and take his watch home to 
his mother, promising to come back in time to die in his 
turn. They let him go, laughmg at the infantine shallowness 
of the pretence ; the little blackguard was afraid ; 
off with you ! He went, and returned. Even the 
soldiers of Thiers and Galifet could not slaughter that 
boy ; the officer in command gave him his life, and the 
master-poet of his nation has given him immortality. 
The verses in which the greater of these two gifts is 
bestowed come like a draught of wine to the lips of one 
sick and faint amid all the pitiful and fearful record of 
evil .inflicted and endured; they refresh, rekindle, reilluminate 
the sunken spirit with a flush and thrill of high delight</p>

<p>But it is possible to meet death with another kind of 
fearlessness than this, a quality which is not of the light 
but of the darkness ; not with divine defiance as a heh), 
but with desperate indifference as a slave : nor is any 
society sound or any state secure which has found out 
no way to cure this dismal readiness to be killed off*, this 
grim facility in dying. Upon all these to whom we have 
made life so hard that old men and children alike are 
ready to leave it without a word or tear, in tragic disdain, 
as of men strangers to their own death, whose grave was 
long since ready dug in their heart ; upon all to whom 
we have refused the right of the body to its meat and the 
right of the spirit to its food, to whom we have given

neither bread nor light, corporeal nurture nor intellectual; 
upon the slaughtered and the banished, the hideous pits 
of quicklime into which the yet warm corpses of men and 
women were huddled, and the more hideous ships of 
transport between whose decks were huddled the living 
agonies of those condemned to the suflferings over which 
in the first years of the fallen empire men shuddered or 
wept, thinking of the innocent as well as the guilty lives 
crushed and worn out in that penal passage, killed by 
cold and heat and foul wretchedness — stifled in dens too 
low to stand upright in, with the sense overhead of the 
moving mass of the huge hurrying ship on its intolerable 
way ; upon all these multitudinous miseries of all who do 
and suffer wrong, the single voice of charity and of reason 
invokes the equal dole and due of pity. At Vianden, 
amid all the sounds and shows of summer, the banished 
poet broods on the bloody problem that is not to be 
solved by file-firing and massacre at haphazard ; all the 
light of the June days is reflected in his verse, but in 
his soul there is no reflection but of graves dug in the 
street for men shot down without trial, of murder feeling 
its way in the dark at random, and victims dispatched 
by chance instead of choice. With the intense and 
subtle beauty of this Jime landscape, where the witness 
could see no sympathy with the human trouble of the 
time, we may compare that former picture of the grim 
glory of a November sky after sunset, seen from the 
invested walls of Paris, when heaven did seem in harmony 
with the time, and the watcher saw there a reflection of 
war and mourning, from the west as white as a shroud 
to the east as black as a pall and alon the line of

horizon the likeness of a blood-red sword let fall from the 
hand of a god after some battle with a giant of equal 
stature.</p>

<p>For all this, notwithstanding, the watchword of the 
poem is hope, and not despair. <quote>" All this horror has 
hope in it ; the ice-cold morning chills the sky-line as 
with fear ; at times the day begins with such a shudder 
that the rising sun seems a masked attack. — The coming 
wave of the unknown has but a dull and livid transparence, 
into which the light comes but by degrees; 
what it shows us, seems to float and drift in folds 
immeasurable. The expansion of form and number appals 
us, and it is horrible to see to-day in the darkness what 
ought only to be seen to-morrow. "</quote> By the parable of the 
robin's nest found in the hollow of the brazen mouth of 
the Waterloo lion, we are bidden see and hear the future 
in the womb of the present, hope in the jaws of despair, 
the song of peace in the very throat of war. Thus it is 
but natural that the poet should hearken rather to the 
higher voice than to the voice of expediency, to the 
counsellor whose name is Reason, whose forename is
Interest ; to the friendly admonition which reminds him 
that truth which is over true is all but falsehood ; that in 
seeking the ideal you find the visionary, and become a 
dreamer through being too much a thinker ; that the wise 
man cioes not wish to be unjust, but fears on the other 
hand to be too just, and seeks a middle course between 
falsehood, which is the first danger, and truth, which is 
the second ; that Right in the rough is merely the ore 
from which in its crude state we have to extract the pure 
gold of Law j that too much light is as sure to blind you

as too much darkness, and if necessary you should not 
open the shutter more than halfway ; that war and the 
scaffold axe detestable in theory, and practically serviceable : 
that the shop must be set up against the temple, 
though the money-changers were once on a time driven 
out of it — for the fault of Jesus was to be something too 
much a God ; that in all things wisdom is moderation, 
and from its quiet corner can remark and reprehend the 
flaws and excesses of the universe ; as for instance that 
though the sun be splendid and the spring be sweet; the 
one has too many beams and the other has too many roses ; 
this is the inconvenience of all things of the kind, and 
God is by no means free from exaggeration ; to imitate 
him is to fall into perfection — a grave risk ; all work is 
done better after a lesser model, and God does not always 
set the best example to follow. What is the use of being 
inaccessible ? Jesus goes too far in declining to take the 
offer of Beelzebub into consideration ; not that I say he 
ought to close with it-; but it is stupid for God to be rude 
when the devil is civil ; it would have been better to say, 
<q>"I'll think it over, my good friend."</q> After all, man is 
man ; he is not wicked, and he is not good ; by no means 
white as snow, but by no means black as coal ; black atid 
white, piebald, striped, dubious, sceptical Seeing that 
men are small and their conscience dwarfish, the statesman 
takes their measure before he ventures anything : he 
astonishes them, but without any thunderclaps of genius or 
daring which might make their heads giddy; he gets 
them up prodigies proportioned to their size. The voice 
of wisdom then proceeds to recapitulate all the troubles 
which a contrary line of conduct has brought on the

scomer who still turns a deaf ear to her counsel : he has 
got himself stoned out of Brussels ; the rattlesnakes of 
the press shake their rattles at him, the clerical and 
imperial gazettes have brought to light all his secret sins, 
drunkenness, . theft, avarice, inhospitality, the bad wine 
and lenten fare set before his guests, and so forth ; M. 
Veuillot is so witty as to call him pumpkin-head ; it is all 
his own fault ; to resist evil is doubtless a good thing, but 
it is a bad thing to stand alone ; to rate and rebuke success, 
to be rough with those who have the upper hand, is 
really a blockhead's trick ; all conquerors are in the right, 
and all that glitters is gold : the god of the winds is God, 
and the weathercock is the symbol of his worship. — And 
then there is always some little admixture of positive right 
in actual fact, some little residue of good discoverable in 
all evil, which it should be your business to seek out If 
Torquemada is in power you warm yourself at the stake. — 
It is better to look for the real than for the true ; the 
reality will help you to live, the truth will be the ruin of 
you ; the reality is afraid of the truth. — A man's duty is 
just to make use of facts ; you (says the voice of good 
counsel) have read it wrong : you are like a man who 
should take a star out of heaven to light him when a 
candle wovild serve better to see the way by. To this 
sound advice we see too plainly that the hearer on whom 
it is wasted prefers the dictation of the voice which speaks 
in answer, admitting that this low sort of light may have 
its partisans, may be found excellent and may really be 
useful to avoid a shock, ward off a projectile, walk 
wellnigh straight by in the dark cross-roads, and find your 
whereabouts among small duties ; it serves publicans very

well as a lamp for their counters; it has on its side, very 
naturally, the purblind, the clever, the cunning, the 
prudent, the discreet, those who can only see things close, 
those who scrutinize a spider's web. But there must be 
somebody on the side of the stars ! somebody to stand 
up for brotherhood, for mercy, for honour, for right, for 
freedom, and for the solemn splendour of absolute truth. 
With all their sublimity and serenity, flowers as they are 
of summer everlasting, the shining constellations have 
need that the world they guide should bear them witness 
that they shine, and some man's voice be raised in every 
age to reassure his brothers by such cry of testimony 
uttered across the night ; for nothing would be so terrible 
as an ultimate equality of good and evil, of light and 
darkness, in the sight of the supreme and infinite unknown world ; 
nothing would bring so heavy an indictment against God as the mad and senseless waste of 
light unprofitably lost and scattered about the hollow deep 
of heaven without the direction of a will. This absence 
of will, this want of conscience in the world, the prophet 
of belief refuses to accept as possible. In the last poem 
of the book he rejects the conception of evil as triumphant 
in the end, of nature as a cheat so ghastly and so base 
that God ought to hide himself for shame, of a heaven 
which shelters from sight a divine malefector, of some one 
hiding behind the starry veil of the abyss who premeditates 
a crime, of man as having given all, the days 
of his life, the tears of his eyes, the blood of his heart, 
only to be made the august plaything of treacherous 
omnipotence : it would not be worth while for the winds 
to stir the stormy tide of our lives, for the morning to

come forth of the sea and dazzle the blinded flowers with 
broadcast seed of diamond, for the bird to sing, or for 
the world to be, if fate were but a hunter on the trail of 
his prey, if all man's efforts brought forth but vanity, if 
the darkness were his child and his mother were the dust, 
if he rowed on night and day, putting forth his will, 
pouring out his blood, discovering and creating, to no 
end but a frightful arrival nowhither ; then might man, 
nothing as he is, rise up in judgment against God and 
take to witness the skies and stars on his behalf. But it 
is not so ; whence morning rises, the future shall surely 
rise ; the dawn is a plighted word of everlasting engagement
 ; the visible firmament is as it were a divine 
promise to pay ; and the eternal and infinite God is not 
bankrupt </p>

<p>In the strength of this faith a man may well despise 
all insult and all falsehood thrown up at him, all railing 
and mockery of his country or his creed from the unclean 
lips of church pamphleteers and other such creatures of 
the darkness and the dirt as in all lands alike are bred 
firom the obscurer and obscener parts of literature. These 
are to him no more than the foul bog-water at its foot is 
to the oak whose boughs are the whole forest's dome ; 
than the imlovely insects of the dust that creep beneath 
it are to the marble giant, august in its mutilation — to the 
colossal Sphinx of rose-tinged granite, grim and great, 
that sits with hands on knees all through the night wherein 
the shaken palm-trees shiver, waiting for its moment to 
speak to the sunrise, and unconscious if any reptile 
beslaver its base. The god has never known that a toad

silence his awful mystery of hidden sound and utterance 
withheld ; and the swarming of centipedes without number 
cannot take from Memnon, suddenly struck radiant, 
the great and terrible voice that makes answer to the 
sun. Those minute and multitudinous creatures who revile 
and defame the great — and thereby, says Blake, <!-- Quote attributed to author; author present. -->
<quote>" blaspheme God, for there is no other God "</quote> — have no 
more power to disturb the man defamed than the judges 
who try the Revolution at their bar and give sentence 
against it have power to undo its work ; their wrath and 
their mourning are in vain; the long festival of the 
ravenous night is over, the world of darkness is in the 
throes of death ; the dreadful daylight has come ; the 
flitter-mouse is blind, the polecat strays about squealing, 
the glowworm has lost his glory, the fox, alas, sheds tears ; 
the beasts that used to go out hunting in the evening at 
the time when little birds go to sleep are at their last

line ; they ask God for nothing but his sun ; it is enough 
for little Jeanne that the sky should be blue. Over his 
son's and their father's grave the poet sees two little 
figures darkened by the dim shadow and gilded by the 
vague light of the dead. He speaks to them sweet and 
sublime words of blessing and of prophecy ; of the glad 
heavenly ignorance that is theirs now, of the sad great 
knowledge that must be one day theirs. With the last 
and loftiest notes of that high soft music in our ears, we 
will leave off our labour of citation and exposition.

<p>A poem having in it any element of greatjiess is likely 
to arouse many questions with regard to the poetic art 
in general, and certain in that case to illustrate them widi 
fresh lights of its own. This of Victor Hugo's at once 
suggests two points of frequent and fruitless debate 
between critics of the higher kind. The first, whether 
poetry and politics are irreconcilable ot not ; the second, 
whether art should prefer to deal with things immediate 
or with things remote. Upon both sides of either question 
it seems to me that even wise men have ere now been 
led from errors of theory to errors of decision. The 
wellknown formula of art for art's sake, opposed as it has 
ever been to the practice of the poet who was so long 
credited with its authorship, has like other doctrines a 
true side to it and an untrue. Taken as an affirmative, 
it is a precious and everlasting truth. No work of art 
has any worth or life in it that is not done on the absolute 
terms of art ; that is not before all things and above 
all things a work of positive excellence as judged by the 
laws of the special art to whose laws it is amenable. If 
the rules and conditions of that art be not observed, or 
if the work done be not great and perfect enough to rank 
among its triumphs, the poem, picture, statue, is a failure 
irredeemable and inexcusable by any show or any proof 
of high purpose and noble meaning. The rule of art is 
not the rule of morals ; in morals the action is judged by 
the intention, the doer is applauded, excused, or condemned, 
according to the motive which induced his deed ; 
in art, the one question is not what you mean but what 
you do. Therefore, as I have said elsewhere, the one 
primary requisite of art is artistic worth ; <quote>" art for art's 

<pb num="42"/>
<fw type="pageNum">42</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

sake first, and then all things shall be added to her — or 
if not, it is a matter of quite secondary importance ; but 
from him that has not this one indispensable quality of 
the artist, shall be taken away even that which he has ; 
whatever merit of aspiration, sentiment, sincerity, he may 
naturally possess, admirable and serviceable as in other 
lines of work it might have been and yet may be, is here 
unprofitable and unpraiseworthy."</quote> Thus far we are at 
one with the preachers of <quote>"art for art;"</quote> we prefer for 
example Goethe to Körner and Sappho to Tyrtæus ; we 
would give many patriots for one artist, considering that 
civic virtue is more easily to be had than lyric genius, 
and that the hoarse monotony of verse lowered to the 
level of a Spartan understanding, however commendable 
such verse may be for the doctrine delivered and the duty 
inculcated upon all good citizens, is of less than no value 
to art, while there is a value beyond price and beyond 
thought in the Lesbian music which spends itself upon 
the record of fleshly fever and amorous malady. We 
admit then that the worth of a poem has properly nothing 
to do with its moral meaning or design ; that the praise 
of a Cæsar as sung by Virgil, of a Stuart as sung by 
Dryden, is preferable to the most magnanimous invective 
against tyranny which love of country and of liberty 
could wring from a Bavius or a Settie ; but on the other 
hand we refuse to admit that art of the highest kind may 
not ally itself with moral or religious passion, with the 
ethics or the politics of a nation or an age. It does not 
detract from the poetic supremacy of Æchylus and of 
Dante, of Milton and of Shelley, that they should have 
been pleased to put their art to such use ; nor does it de- 

<ob num="43"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'ANNÉE TERRIBLE.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">43</fw> 

tract from the sovereign greatness of other poets that they 
should have had no note of song for any such theme. In 
a woid, the doctrine of art for art is true in the positive 
sense, false in the negative ; sound as an affirmation, 
unsound as a prohibition. If it be not true that the only 
absolute duty of art is the duty she owes to herself, then 
must art be dependent on the alien conditions of subject 
and of aim ; whereas she is dependei^t on herself alone, 
and on nothing above her or beneath ; by her own law 
she must stand or fall, and to that alone she is responsible ; 
by no other law can any work of art be condemned, 
by no other plea can it be saved. But while we refuse 
to any artist on any plea the license to infringe in the 
least article the letter of this law, to overlook or overpass 
it in the pursuit of any foreign purpose, we do not refuse 
to him the liberty of bringing within the range of it any 
subject that under these conditions may. be so brought 
and included within his proper scope of work. This 
liberty the men who take <q>"art for art"</q> as their motto, 
using the words in an exclusive sense, would refuse to 
concede; they see with perfect clearness and accuracy 
that art can never be a <q>" handmaid "</q> of any <q>" lord,"</q> as
the moralist, pietist, or politician would fain have her be ; 
and therefore they will not allow that she can properly be 
even so much as an ally of anything else. So on the one 
side we have the judges who judge of art by her capacity 
to serve some other good end than the production of 
good work ; these would leave us for instance <title>King John</title>, 
but would assuredly deprive us of <title>As You Like It</title>; the 
national devotion and patriotic fire of <title>King Henry V</title>. 
would suffice in their estimation to set it far above the 

<pb num="44"/>
<fw type="pageNum">44</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

sceptic and inconclusive meditations of <title>Hamlet</title>, 
the pointless and aimless beauty of <title>A Midsummer Night's Dream</title>. 
On the other side we have the judges who would ostracise 
every artist found guilty of a moral sense, of the political 
faith or the religious emotion of patriots and heroes; 
whose theory would raze the Persæ from the scroll of 
Æschylus, and leave us nothing of Dante but the Vita 
Nuova, of Milton but the Allegro and Penseroso, of 
Shelley but the Skylark and the Cloud. In consistency 
the one order of fanatics would expel from the poetic 
commonwealth such citizens as Coleridge and Keats, the 
other would disfranchise such as Bums and ByroiL The 
simple truth is that the question at issue between them is 
that illustrated by the old child's parable of the gold and 
silver shield. Art is one, but the service of art is diverse. 
It is equally foolish to demand of a Goethe, a Keats, or 
a Coleridge, the proper and natural work of a Dante, a 
Milton, or a Shelley, as to invert the demand ; to arraign 
the <title>Divina Commedia</title> in the name of Faust, the <title>Sonnet 
on the Massacres</title> in Piedmont in the name of the <title>Ode 
on a Grecian Urn</title>, or the <title>Ode to Liberty</title> in the name of 
Kubla Khan. I know nothing stranger in the history of 
criticism than the perversity even of eminent and exquisite 
critics in persistent condemnation of one great 
artist for his deficiency in the qualities of another. It is 
not that critics of the higher kind expect to gather grapes 
of thorns or figs of thisties ; but they are too frequentiy 
surprised and indignant that they cannot find grapes on 
a fig-tree or figs on a vine. M. Auguste Vacquerie has 
remarked before me on this unreasonable expectation and 
consequent irritation of the critical mind, with his usual 

<pb num="45"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'ANNÉE TERRIBLE.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">45</fw> 

bright and swift sense of the truth — a quality which 
we are sure to find when a good artist has occasion to 
speak of his own art and the theories current with respect 
to it In this matter proscription and prescription are 
alike -unavailing; it is equally futile to bid an artist forego 
the natiu:al bent of his genius or to bid him assume the 
natural office of another. If the spirit or genius proper 
to himself move him for instance to write political poetry, 
he will write it; if it bid him abstain from any such theme 
and write only on personal or ideal subjects, then also 
he will obey ; or if ever he attempt to force his genius 
into unnatiu-al service, constrain it to some alien duty, 
the most praiseworthy purpose imaginable will not suffice 
to put life or worth into the work so done. Art knows 
nothing of choice between the two kinds or preference of 
the one to the other ; she asks only that the artist shall 
<quote>" follow his star "</quote> with the faith and the fervour: of Dante, 
whether it lead him on a path like or unlike the way of 
Dante's work ; the ministers of either tribe, the savours 
of either sacrifice, are equally excellent in her sight. </p>

<p>The question whether past or present afford the 
highest matter for high poetry and offer the noblest 
reward to the noble workman has been as loudly and as 
long debated, but is really less debateable on any rational 
ground than the question of the end and aim of art It 
is but lost labour that the champions on one side summon 
us to renounce the present and all its works, and return 
to bathe our spirits in the purer air and living springs of 
the past ; it is but waste of breath for the champions of 
the other party to bid us break the yoke and cast off the 
bondage of that past, leave the dead to bury their dead, 

<pb num="46"/>
<fw type="pageNum">46</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

and turn from the dust and rottenness of old-world themes, 
epic or romantic, classical or feudal, to face the age 
wherein we live and move and have our being, to send forth 
our souls and songs in search of the wonderful and 
doubtful future. Art knows nothing of time; for her 
there is but one tense, and all ages in her sight are alike 
present ; there is nothing old in her sight, and nothing 
new. It is true, as the one side urges, that she fears not 
to face the actual aspect of the hour, to handle if it please 
' her the inunediate matters of the day ; it is true, as the 
other side insists, that she b free to go back when she 
will to the very beginnings of tradition and fetch her 
subject from the fiurthest of ancient days ; she cannot be 
vulgarised by the touch of the present or deadened by 
the contact of the past In vain, for instance, do the first 
poetess of England and the first poet of America agree 
to urge upon their fellows or their followers the duty of 
confronting and expressing the spirit and the secret of 
their own time, its meaning and its need ; such work is 
worthy of a poet, but no worthier than any other work 
that has in i^ the principle of life. And a poem of the past, 
if otherwise as good, has in it as much of this principle as 
a poem of the present If a poem cast in the mould of 
classic or feudal times, of Greek drama or mediaeval 
romance, be lifeless and worthless, it is not because the 
subject or the form was ancient, but because the poet 
was inadequate to his task, incompetent to do better than 
a flat and feeble imitation ; had he been able to fill the 
old types of art with new blood and breath, the remoteness 
of subject and the antiquity of form would in no 
wise have impaired the worth and reality of his work ; he 

<pb num="47">
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'ANNÉE TERRIBLE.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">47</fw> 

would have brought close to us the far-off loveliness and 
renewed for us the ancient life of his models, not by 
mechanical and servile transcript as of a copying clerk, 
but by loving and reverent emulation as of an original 
fellow-craftsman. No form is obsolete, no subject out of 
date, if the right man be there to rehandle it To the 
question <quote>"Can these bones live?"</quote> there is but one 
answer ; if the spirit and breath of art be breathed upon 
them indeed, and the voice prophesying upon them be 
indeed the voice of a prophet, then assuredly will the 
bones <quote>"come together, bone to his bone;"</quote> and the 
sinews and the flesh will come up upon them, and the 
skin cover them above, and the breath come into them, 
and they will live. For art is very life itself, and knows 
nothing of death ; she is absolute truth, and takes no 
care of fact ; she sees that Achilles and Ulysses are even 
now more actual by far than Wellington and Talleyrand ; 
not merely more noble and more interesting as types and 
figures, but more positive and real ; and thus it is (as 
Victor Hugo has himself so finely instanced it) <quote>" that 
Trimalchio is alive, while the late M. Romieu is dead."</quote>
Vain as is the warning of certain critics to beware of the 
present and abstain from its immediate vulgarities and 
realities, not less vain, however nobly meant or nobly 
worded, is the counter admonition to " mistrust the poet" 
who <quote>"trundles back his soul"</quote> some centuries to sing of 
chiefe and ladies <quote>"as dead as must be, for the greater 
part, the poems made on their heroic bones ; "</quote> for if he 
be a poet indeed, these will at once be reclothed with 
instant flesh and reinspired with immediate breath, as 
present and as true, as palpable and as precious, as any- 

<pb nume="48"/>
<fw type="pageNum">48</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

thing most near and real ; and if the heroic bones be still 
fleshless and the heroic poems .lifeless, the fault is not in 
the bones but in the poems, not in the theme but in the 
singer. As vain it is, not indeed to invite the muse to 
new spheres and fresher fields whither also she will surely 
and gladly come, but to bid her <quote>" migrate from Greece 
and Ionia, cross out those immensely overpaid accounts, 
that matter of Troy, and Achilles' wrath, and Æneas', 
Odysseus' wanderings ; "</quote> forsake her temples and casdes 
of old for the new quarters which doubdess also suit hCT 
well and make her welcome ; for neither epic nor romance 
of chivalrous quest or classic war is obsolete yet, or ever 
can be ; there is nothing in the past extinct ; no scroll is 
<quote>"closed for ever,"</quote> no legend or vision of Hellenic or 
feudal faith <quote>"dissolved utterly like an exhalation:"</quote> all 
that ever had life in it has life in it for ever ; those themes 
only are dead which never were other than dead. <quote>" She 
has left them all, and is here ; "</quote> so the prophet of the new 
world vaunts himself in vain ; she is there indeed, as he 
says, <quote>" by thud of machinery and shrill steam-whisde 
undismayed — smiling and pleased, with palpable intent to 
stay ; "</quote> but she has not needed for that to leave her old 
abodes ; she is not a dependent creature of time or place, 
<quote>" servile to all the skiey influences ; "</quote> she need not climb 
mountains or cross seas to bestow on all nations at once 
the light of her countenance ; she is omnipresent and 
eternal, and forsakes neither Athens nor Jerus^em, 
Camelot nor Troy, Argonaut nor Crusader, to dwell as 
she does widi equal good-will among modem appliances 
in London and New York. All times and all places are 
one to her ; the stuff she deals with is eternal, and eter- 

<pb num="49"/>
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'ANNÉE TERRIBLE.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">49</fw> 

nally the same; no time or theme is inapt for her, no 
past or present preferable.</p>

<p>We do not therefore rate this present book higher or 
lower because it deals with actual politics and matter of 
the immediate day. It is true that to all who put their 
faith and hope in the republican principle it must bring 
comfort and encouragement, a sense of strength and a 
specialty of pleasure, quite apart from the delight in its 
beauty and power; but it is not on this ground tliat 
we would base its i^im to the reverent study and thankful 
admiration of men. The first and last thirig to be 
noted in it is the fact of its artistic price and poetic 
greatness. Those who share the faith and the devotion 
of the writer have of course good reason to rejoice that 
the first poet of a great age, the foremost voice of a great 
nation, should speak for them in the ears of the world ; 
that the highest poetry of their time should take up the 
cause they have at heart, and set their belief to music. 
To have with us Victor Hugo in the present as we have 
Milton and Shelley in the past is not a matter to be 
lightly prized. Whether or not we may be at one with 
the master-singer on all points is a matter of less weight ; 
whether we have learnt to look to Rome or to Paris, 
regenerate and redeemed firom imperial or sacerdotal 
damnation, for the fiiture light and model of republican 
Europe, we can receive with equal sympathy the heroic 
utterince of the greatest Frenchman's trust in the country 
and the city of the Revolution. Not now, after so many 
days of darkness, after so many stages of terror and pity, 
can any lover of France be inclined to cavil at the utmost 
expression of loyalty, the utmost passion of worship,

which the first of her sons may offer in the time of her 
sore need. All men's mouths were opened against the 
sins and shames of Paris; stricken of her enemies, 
forsaken of her fiiends, the great city was naked to all 
assault of hostile hands or tongues ; she was denied and 
renounced of Europe ; it was time for the poet to take 
her part We need not recall, though we cannot but 
remember, the source of all her ills ; the first and foulest 
crime of a fruitful and baneful series, the murder of tho 
Roman republic by the hands of Frrtich republicans ; a 
crime which naturally and perforce brought forth at once 
its counterpart and its retribution in the minor though 
monstrous crime of December; which overthrew the 
triumvirate in Rome, and founded the empire in Paris. 
For that infamous expedition against right and fi^edom 
the nation which perpetrated and the nations which 
permitted it have since had heavily to pay. Not firom 
the chief criminal alone, but from all accomplices who 
stood silent by to watch with folded hands the violation 
of all international conscience and the consummation of 
all international treason, has time exacted the full price 
of blood in blood and gold and shame. For the commission 
by France and the condonation by Europe of 
the crime which reinthralled a people and reinstalled a 
priesthood, even the infliction of the second empire was 
not found too costly an atonement to be exacted by the 
terrible equity of fate. But that the scourge fell first and 
heaviest on those Frenchmen who had protested and 
struggled with all the strength of their conscience and 
their soul against the sin and the shame of their country, 
men might have watched almost <quote>" with a bitter and severe

delight "</quote> the assassination in its turn of republican France 
while yet red-handed from the blood of republican Rome. 
But it was not for the greatest of those among her sons 
who had resisted that execrable wrong, and being innocent of 
bloodguiltiness had suffered in expiation of it for 
nineteen years of exile— it was not for Hugo, and it is 
not for us, to cast in her teeth the reproach of her sin 
now that it has been atoned for by a heroic agony. Yet 
in reading these ardent and profuse invocations of France 
as prophetess and benefactress, fountain of light and 
symbol of right, we must feel now and then that some 
recognition of past wrong-doing, some acknowledgment 
of treason and violence done against the right and the 
light of the world, would have added weight and force to 
the expression of a patriotism which in default of it may 
be open to the enemy's charge of vulgar and uncandid 
partisanship, of blind and one-sided provinciality. From 
these as from all other charges of narrowness or shallowness,
want of culture, of judgment, and of temperance, 
we would win see the noble ardour and loving passion of 
his fiiith as demonstrably clear in all men's eyes as in the 
main it is at bottom to those who can read it aright To 
have admitted that the empire was not simply a crime 
and a shame imposed on France as though by accident, 
but an inevitable indenmity demanded for her sin against 
her own high mission and honour, for the indulgence of 
greed and envy, of the lust after mean renown and 
unrighteous power which is the deformed and vicious 
parody of that virtue of patriotism whose name it takes 
in vain to make it hateful, of the arrogant and rancorous 
jadousy which impelled her baser politicians to play the 

<!-- E2 -->

<pb num="52"/>
<fw type="pageNum">52</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

game of the Catholic faction and let loose upon free Italy 
the soldiers of the Republic as the bloodhounds of the 
Church — to have avowed and noted this as the first and 
strongest link in the &tal chain of cause and effect wound 
up from Mentana to Sedan, could but have given fresh 
point and fresh profit to the fiery proclamation of France 
rearisen and redeemed. Then the philosophy and 
patriotism of the poet would not have been liable to the 
imputation of men who are now led to confound them 
with the common cries and conceits of that national 
egotism which has led to destruction the purblind and 
rapacious policy of sword-play and tongue-play. As it 
is, if ever tempted to find fault with the violence of 
devotion which insists on exalting above all names the name 
of Paris — Paris entire, and Paris alone — without alloy or 
reserve of blame or regret for its follies and fidsities, 
its windy vanities and rootless resdess mobility of mind, 
to qualify the praise of its faith and ardour in pursuit of 
the light, we may do well to consider that this hymn of 
worship is raised rather to the ideal city, the archetypal 
nation, the symbolic people, of which he has prophesied 
in that noble dithyrambic poem in prose prefixed 
originally to the book called <tilte>" Paris Guide."</title> Whether or
not that prophecy be accepted as a prediction, the 
speaker cannot fairly be accused of making his voice the 
mere echo of the blatant ignorance and strident selfassertion 
of the platform. Not but that some sharper 
word of warning or even of rebuke might perhaps have 
profitably tempered the warmth of his loyal and filial acclamation. 
With this, and with some implied admission 
of those good as well as evil elements in the composition 

<pb num="53">
<fw type="header" xml:lang="fr">L'ANNÉE TERRIBLE.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">53</fw> 

of the German empire and army which gave his enemie;3 
their strength, the intellectual and historical aspect of the 
poem would be complete and unassailable. From all 
other points of view it stands out in perfect unity of relief, 
as an absolute type of what poetry can do with a 
tragic or epic subject of the poet's own time. For a 
continuous epic or tragedy he gives us in appearance a 
series of lyric episodes which once completed and 
harmonized are seen to fulfil the conditions and compose 
the structure of a great and single work of art Thus 
only can such a work be done in simple and sensible 
accordance with that unwritten law of right wliich is to 
the artist as a natural and physical instinct.</p>

<p>We accept then without reserve this great gift, for 
which the student can pay but thanks to the master 
whose payment from the world is the liatred of base men 
and the love of noble. In the mighty roll of his works 
we recognise at once that it must hold a high place for 
ever. That intense moral passion which may elsewhere 
have overflowed the bounds and <quote>" o'er-informed the 
tenement "</quote> of drama or romance has here a full vent in 
its proper sphere. This sovereign quality of the prophet 
is a glorious and dangerous quality for a poet. The 
burning impulse and masterful attraction of the soul 
towards ideas of justice and ^ mercy, which make a man 
dedicate his genius to the immediate ofhce of consolation 
and the immediate service of right, must be liable at times 
to divert the course of his work and impair the process 
of his art To those who accused him of not 
imitating in his plays the method of that supreme 
dramatist in whom he professed his faith, Victor Hugo 

<pb num="54">
<fw type="pageNum">54</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

has well answered that it was not his part to imitate 
Shakespeare or any man ; that the proof of vitality and 
value in the modem drama was that it had a life and a 
form, a body and a soul of its own. Nevertheless we may 
notice, with all reverence for the glorious dramatic work 
and fame of the first poet of our age, that on one point 
he might in some men's judgment have done well to 
follow as far as was possible to his own proper genius the 
method of Shakespeare. The ideal dramatist, an archetype 
once incarnate and made actual in the greatest of 
all poets, has no visible preferences ; in his capacity of 
artist he is incapable of personal indignation or predilection ; 
as Keats with subtle truth and sovereign 
insight has remarked, he <quote> " has as much delight in 
conceiving an lago as an Imogen."</quote> <!-- Use <cit> instead? -->

For the time being, throughout the limits of his design, he maintains in awful 
equanimity of apparent abstraction the high indifference 
of nature or of God. Evil and good, and things and men, 
are in his hands as day in the potter's, and he moulds 
them to the use and purpose of his art alone. What 
men are, and what their doings and their sufferings, he 
shows you face to face, and not as in a glass darkly ; to 
you he leaves it to comment on the action and passion 
set before you, to love or hate, applaud or condemn, the 
agents and the patients of his mundane scheme, wide as 
time and space, hell-deep and heaven-high. It is for you, 
if you please, to take part with Imogen or Desdemona 
against lago or lachimo, with Arthur or Cordelia against 
Goneril or King John ; he is for all men, inasmuch as 
all are creatures and parcels of himself as artist, and of

that art which <quote>"itself is nature;"</quote> he is not more for 
Brutus than for Antony, for Portia or Volumnia than for 
Cleopatra. This supreme office, it is evident, can 
scarcely b« fulfilled by a poet of whom it is possible for 
his most loving disciple and the son of his adoption to 
say, as Auguste Vacquerie has said of Victor Hugo, that 
all his works are acts of public virtue and charity, that his 
books are consecrated to the study and the relief of all 
sufferings, that his pla3rs are dedicated to all the outcast 
and disinherited of the world. It is the general presence 
and predominance of this predetertninate and prepense 
design which has exposed his marvellous work to the 
charge of too deliberate and mechanical preparation, too 
studious premeditation of eflfect, too careful preoccupation 
of result This in fact is the sum and sense of those 
imputations of calculated extravagance or preconcerted 
patlios and puppetry of passion done to order, outer heat 
of artificial fire with inner frost of spiritual cold, cast 
upon him by the only two famous men, among many 
infamous and obscure, who have attempted to impugn 
his greatness. But the most devout believer in Goethe's 
or in Heine's judgment, if not blind as well as devout, 
must allow that the edge of their criticism is somewhat 
blunted by the fact that in the same breath they decry 
with loud and acrid violence of accent the man generally 
acknowledged as chief poet of his age and country, and 
extol in his place the names of such other Frenchmen as 
no countryman of their own outside their private social 
set or literary party could hear cited as his rivals without 
a smile. If &ult be found in our hearing by any critic 
of general note and repute with some alleged shortcoming 
in the genius or defect in the workmanship of 

<pb num="56"/>
<fw type="pageNum">56</fw> <fw type="header">VICTOR HUGO:</fw> 

Shakespeare, of Michel Angelo, or of Handel, the force 
of the objection will be somewhat taken off when we find 
that the eminent fault-finder proposes to exalt in their 
stead as preferable objects of worship the works of 
Racine, of Guido, or of Rossini ; and in like manner we 
are constrained to think less of the objections taken to 
Hugo by the Jupiter of Weimar and the Aristophanes of 
Germany, when we find that Goethe offers us as a substitute 
for his Titanic sculptures the exquisite jewellery and 
faultless carvings of <text xml:lang="fr">Prosper Mérimée</text>
; as though . one should offer to supplant the statuary <quote>"in that small 
chapel of the dim St. Laurence,"</quote> not by that of the 
Panathenaic series, but by the white marble shrine of Orcagna 
in which the whole legend of the life of Mary is so 
tenderly and wonderfully wrought in little ; while Heine 
would give us, for the sim of that most active and passionate 
genius, its solar strength and heat, its lightning 
and its light, the intermittent twinkle of a planet now 
fiery as a shooting star, now watery as a waning moon — 
sweet indeed and bright for the space of its hour, and 
anon &llen as an exhalation in some barren and quaking 
bog ; woxild leave to France, in lieu of the divine and 
human harmony and glory of Hugo's mighty line, the 
fantastic tenderness and ardent languor, the vacuous 
monotonous desire and discontent, the fitfid and febrile 
beauty of Alfred de Musset.</p> 

<p>But whether or not there be reason in the objection 
that even such great works as <title xml:lang="fr">" Marion de Lorme "</title> and 
<title xml:lang="fr">" Ruy Bias "</title> are comparatively discoloured by this moral 
earnestness and strenuous preference of good to evil, or 
that besides this alleged distortion and diversion of art

from its proper line of work, too much has been sacrificed 
or at least subordinated to the study of stage surprises 
conveyed in a constant succession of galvanic shocks, as 
though to atone for neglect or violation of dramatic duty 
and the inner law of artistic growth and poetic propriety 
by excess of outward and theatrical observance of effect ; 
whether or not these and such-like deductions may be 
made firom the fame of this great poet as dramatist or as 
novelist, in such a book as that now before us this quality 
is glorious only and dangerous no more. The partisanship 
which is the imperfection of a play is the perfection of a 
war-song or other national lyric, be it of lamentation, of 
exhortation, or of triumph. This book of song takes its 
place beyond question beside the greatest on that lyric 
list which reaches from the <title xml:lang="fr">" Odes et Ballades "</fw> to the
<title xml:lang="fr">" Chansons des Rues et des Bois ; "</title> such a list of labours 
and triumphs as what other lyrist can show ? First come 
the clear boyish notes of prelude, songs of earliest faith 
and fency, royalist and romantic ; then the brilliant vivid 
ballads, fiill already of supple harmonies and potent masteries 
of music, of passion and sentiment, force and grace ; 
then the auroral resonance and radiance of the luminous 
<title xml:lang="fr">" Orientales,"</title> the high and tender cadences of the 
<title xml:lang="fr">" Feuilles d'Automne,"</title> the floating and changing melodies 
of the <title xml:lang="fr">" Chants du Cr^puscule,"</title> the fervent and intimate 
echoes of the <title xml:lang="fr">" Voix Int^rieures,"</title> the ardent and subtle 
refractions of <title xml:lang="fr">" Les Rayons et les Ombres ; "</title> each in espedal 
of these two latter books of song crowned by one 
of the most perfect lyrics in all the world of art for 
sweetness and sublimity — the former by those stanzas on the 
sound of the unseen sea by night, which have in them

the very heart and mystery of darkness, the very music 
and the very passion of wave and wind ; the other by 
diat most wonderful and adorable poem in which all the 
sweet and bitter madness of love strong as death is distilled 
into deathless speech, the little lyric tragedy of 
Gastibelza : next, after many silent or at least songless 
years, the pealing thunders and blasting simbeams of the

deeper than all these, the marvellous roll of the 
<title>" Contemplations,"</title> having in it all the stored and secret 
treasures of youth and age, of thought and faith, of love 
and sorrow, of life and death ; with the mystery of the 
stars and the sepulchres above them and beneath : then 
the terrible and splendid chronicle of human evil and 
good, the epic and lyric <title xml:lang="fr">" Légende des Siècles,"</title> with its 
infinite variety of action and passion infernal and divine : 
then the subtle and full-throated carols of vigorous and 
various fancy built up in symmetrical modulation of 
elaborate symphonies by vision or by memory among the 
woods and streets : and now the sorrowful and stormy 
notes of the giant oigan whose keys are the months of 
this <title xml:lang="fr">" Année Terrible."</title> And all these make up but one 
division of the work of one man's life : and we know that 
in the yet unsounded depth of his fathomless genius, as 
in the simless treasure-houses of the sea, there are still 
jewels of what price we know not that must in their tmn 
see light and give light. For these we have a prayer to 
put up that the gift of them may not be long delayed. 
There are few delights in any life so high and rare as the 
subtle and strong delight of sovereign art and poetry ; 
there are none more pure and more sublime. To have

read the greatest works of any great poet, to have beheld 
or heard the greatest works of any great painter or 
musician, is a possession added to the best things of life. 
As we pity ourselves for the loss of poems and pictures 
which have perished, and left of Sappho but a fragment 
and of Zeuxis but a name, so are we inclined to pity the 
dead who died too soon to enjoy the great works that we 
have enjoyed At each new glory that <quote>" swims into our 
ken "</quote> we siurely feel that it is something to have lived to 
see this too rise. Those who might have had such an addition 
to the good things of their life, and were defrauded 
of it by delay, have reason to utter from the shades their 
ghostly complaint and reproach against the giver who 
withheld his gift from the world till they had passed out 
of it, and so made their lives less by one good thing, and 
that good thing a pleasure of great price. We know that 
our greatest poet living has kept back for many years 
some samples of his work ; and much as he has given, 
we are but the more impelled by consideration of that 
imperial mimificence to desire and demand its perfect 
consummation. Let us not have to wait longer than must 
needs be for the gift of our promised treasiures ; for the 
completion of that social and historic trilogy which has 
yet two parts to accomplish ; for the plays whose names

<p><hi rendition="#sc">When</hi> fate has allowed to any man more than one great 
gift, accident or necessity seems usually to contrive that 
one shall encumber and impede the other. It has been 
thought, rightly or wrongly, that even the work done by 
such supreme men as Michel Angelo and Leonardo was 
impaired on this hand or on that by the various and eager 
impatience of genius which impelled them alternately 
along diverging lines of life and labour. Be that as it 
may, there is no room to doubt that such a doublenatured 
genius as was theirs lies open to a double kind 
of attack from the rancorous tribe of weaklings and 
dullards. The haters of either light or of any may say 
that there cannot be sunlight and moonlight in the same 
sky ; that a double-gifted nature must be powerless to 
beget as to bear, sterile by excess of organs as by defect, 
<quote>" like that sweet marble monster of both sexes "</quote> beloved 
of Shelley as of Gautier : that the time and ardour of 
spirit and of hand spent on this way of work must be so 
much lost to that other way ; that on neither course can 
the runner of a double race attain the goal, but must 
needs in both races alike be caught up and resign his 
torch to a runner with, a single aim. Candid envy and 
judicious ignorance will mutually concede something;

the one, that he might have won the foot-race had he let 
the horse-race be ; the other, that he might have ridden 
in first had he never tried his luck afoot That assurance 
refreshes with the restorative of a false consolation the 
runners who fell impotent at starting or dropped lame at 
the turning-point Hateful as the winner of a single prize 
must be to them, how can they bear — ^if shutting their 
eyes will save them the sight — to behold the coronation 
of the conqueror in all five heats ? Nevertheless they 
have now and then to bear it as they may : though some 
take side with them who should know better, having won 
each a single crown in his own field, and being loth to 
admit that in that field at least they can be distanced by 
the best man in another.</p>

<p>In every generation that takes any heed of the art, 
the phrase of <quote>"greatest living poet "</quote> or (with a difference 
of reservation) <quote>" first of his age and country "</quote> is flung 
about freely and foolishly enough : but if more than mere 
caprice — be it caprice of culture or caprice of ignorance — 
is to go to the making up of the definition, we must decide 
what qualities are of first necessity for the best poet, 
and proceed to try how far the claynant can be surely 
said to possess them. Variety is a rare and high quality, 
but poets of the first order have had little or none of it ; 
witness Keats and Coleridge ; men otherwise greater than 
these have had much, and yet have fallen far short of the 
final place among poets held by these ; witness Byron 
4nd Scott But in all great poets there must be an ardent 
iiaimony, a heat of spiritual life guiding without constraining 
the bodily grace of motion, which shall give 
charm and power to their least work; sweetness that

cannot be weak and force that will not be rough. TTiere 
roust be an instinct and a resolution of excellence which 
will allow no shortcoming or malformation of thought or 
word : there must also be so natural a sense of right as to 
make any such deformity or defect impossible, and leave 
upon the work done no trace of any effort to avoid or to 
achieve. It must be serious, simple, perfect ; and it 
must be thus by evident and native impuke. The mark 
of painstaking as surely lowers the level of style as any 
sign of negligence ; in the best work there must be no 
^trace of a laborious or a languid hand.</p>

<p>In all these points the style of Mr. Rossetti excels 
that of any English poet of oiur day. It has the fiiUest 
fervour and fluency of impulse, and the impulse is alwa3rs 
towards harmony and perfection. It has the inimitable 
note of iogtinct, and the instinct is always high and right 
It carries weight enough to overbear the style of a weaker 
man, but no weight of thought can break it, no subtlety 
of emotion attenuate, no ardour of passion deface. It 
can breathe unvexed in the finest air and pass unsinged 
through the keenest fire ; it has all the grace of perfect 
force and all the force of perfect grace. It is sinuous as 
water or as light, flexible and penetrative, delicate and 
rapid ; it works on its way without halt or jar or collapse. 
And in plain strength and weight of sense and sound these 
faultless verses exceed those of faultier workmen who 
earn their effects by their defects ; who attain at times and 
by fits to some memorable impression of thought upon 
speech and speech upon memory, at the cost generally 
of inharmonious and insufficient work. No such coarse 
or cheap stuff is here used as a ground to set off the rich 

<pb num="63"/>

surprises of casual ornament and intermittent embroidery. 
The woof t)f each poem is perfect, and the flowers that 
flash out from this side or from that seem not so much 
interwoven with the thread of it or set in the soil, as ^ 
grQwn_dmLspnmg: by mere nature from the ground, under \ 
inevitable rains and sunbeams of the atmosphere which 
bred them.</p>

It is said sometimes that a man may have a strong ./ 
and perfect style who has nothing to convey worth con- y 
veyance under cover of it. This is indeed a favourite 
saying of men who have no words in which to convey the 
thoughts which they have not ; of men bom dumb who 
express by grunts and chokes the inexpressible eloquence 
which is not in them, and would fain seem to labour in 
miscarriage of ideas which they have never conceived. 
But it remains for them to prove as well as assert that 
beauty and power of expression can accord with emptiness 
or sterijity of matter, or that impotence of articulation 
must imply depth and wealth of thought, l^s flattering 
unction the very foolishest of malignants will hardly in 
this case be able to lay upon the corrosive sore which he 
calls his soul : the ulcer of lU-will must rot unrelieved . 
by the rancid ointment of such Action. Hardly could a 
fool here or a knave there fail to see or hope to deny the 
fullness of living diought and subtle strength of nature 
underlying this veil of radiant and harmonious words.</p> 

<p>It is on the other side that attack might be looked 
for from the more ingenious enemies of good work : and 
of these there was never any lack. Much of Mr. Rossetti's 
work is so intense in aim, so delicate and deep in significance, 
so exuberant in offshoot and undeigrowth of

sentiment and thought, that even the sweet lucidity and 
steady current of his style may not sufl5ce to ipive it from 
the charges of darkness and difficulty. He is too great a 
master of speech to incur the blame of hard or tortuous 
expression ; and his thought is too soimd and pure to be 
otherwise dark than as a deep well-spring at noon may 
be even where the sun is strongest and the water brightest 
In its furthest depth there is nothing of weed or of mud ; 
whatever of haze may seem to quiver there is a weft of 
the sun's spinning, a web not of woven darkness but of 
molten light But such work as this can be neither unwoven 
nor recast by any process of analysis. The infinite 
depth and wealth of life which breathes and plays among 
these songs and sonnets cannot be parcelled and portioned 
out for praise or comment This <title>" House of Life "</title> has 
in it so many mansions, so many halls of state and bowers 
of music, chapels for worship and chambers for festival, 
that no guest can declare on a first entrance the secret of 
its scheme. Spirit and sense together, eyesight and 
hearing and thought, are absorbed in splendour of sounds 
and glory of colours distinguishable only by delight. But 
the scheme is solid and harmonious ; there is no waste in 
this luxury of genius: the whole is lovelier than its 
loveliest part Again and again may one turn the leaves 
in search of some one poem or some two which may be 
chosen for sample and thanksgiving; but there is no 
choice to be made. Sonnet is poured upon sonnet, and 
song hands on the torch to song ; and each in turn (as 
another poet has said of the lark's note falling from the 
height of dawn)

There are no poems of the class in English — I doubt if 
there be ^y even in Dante's Italian — so rich at once 
and pure. Their golden affluence of images and jewelcoloured 
words never once disguises the firm outline, the 
justice and chastity of form. No nakedness could be 
more harmonious, more consimimate in its fleshly sculpture, 
than the imperial array and ornament of this august 
poetry. Mailed in gold as of the morning and girdled / 
with gems of strange water, the beautiful body as of a 
carven goddess gleams through them tangible and taintless, 
without spot or default There is not a jewel here 
but it fits, not a beauty but it subserves an end. There 
seems no story in this sequence of sonnets, yet they hold 
in them all the action and passion of a spiritual history 
withJragic stages and elegiac pauses and lyric motions of 
the living soul. Their earnest subtleties and exquisite 
ardours recall to mind the sonnets of Shakespeare; 
poems in their way unapproachable, and here in no wise 
imitated. Shakespeare's have at times a far more 
passionate and instant force, a sharper note of delight or 
agony or mystery, fear or desire or remorse — a keener 
truth and more pungent simpleness of sudden phrase, 
with touches of sound and flashes of lijht beyond all 
reach ; Mr. Rossetti's have a nobler fullness of form, a 
more stately and shapely beauty of build : they are of a . 
purer and less turbid water than the others are at times, 
and not less fervent when more serene than they; the 
subject-matter of them is sweet throughout, natural always 
and dear, however intense and fine in remote and delicate 
intricacy of spiritual stuff. There is nothing here which 
may not be felt by any student who can grasp the Subtle

sense of it in full, as a just thing and admirable, fit for 
the fellowship of men's feelings ; if men indeed have in 
them enough of noble fervour and loving delicacy, enough 
of truth and warmth in the blood and breath of their souls, 
enough of brain and heart for such fellow-feeling. For 
something of these they must have to bring with them 
who would follow the radiant track of this verse through 
brakes of flowers and solitudes of sunlight, past fountains 
hidden under green bloom of leaves, beneath roof-work 
of moving boughs where song and silence are one musia 
All passion and regret and strenuous hope and fiery contemplation, 
all beauty and glory of thought and vision, 
are built into this golden house where the lifethat reigns 
is love; the very face of sorrow is not cold or withered, 
but has the breath of heaven between its fresh live lips 
and the light of pure sweet blood in its cheeks ; there is 
a glow of summer on the red leaves of its regrets and the 
starry fi-ost-flakes of its tears. Resignation and firuition, 
forethought and afterthought, have one voice to sing with 
in many keys of spirit A more bitter sweetness of sincerity
 was never pressed into verse than beats and bums 
here under the veil and girdle of glorious words; there 
are no poems anywhere of more passionate meditation or 
vision more intense than those on <title>" Lost Days,"</title> <title>" Vain 
Virtues,"</title> <title>"The Sun's Shame;"</title> none of more godlike 
grace and sovereign charm than those headed <title>" New-bom 
Death,"</title> <title>" A Superscription,"</title> <title>" A Dark Day,"</title> <title>" Known 
in Vain,"</title> <title>" The One Hope."</title> And of all splendid and 
profound love-poetry, what is there more luminous or 
more deep in sense and spirit than the marvellous opening 
cycle of twenty-^ight sonnets, which embrace and express

all sorrow and all joy of passion in union, of outer love 
and inner, triumphant or dejected or piteous or at peace? 
No one till he has read these knows all of majesty 
and melody, all of energy and emotion, all of supple 
and significant loveliness, all of tender cunning and 
exquisite strength, which our language can show at need 
in proof of its powers and uses. The birth of love, 
his eucharistic presence, his supreme vision, his utter 
union in flesh and spirit, the secret of the sanctuary of 
his heart, his louder music and his lower, his graver and 
his lighter seasons; all work of love and all play, all 
dreams and devices of his memory and his belief, all 
fuller and emptier hours from the first which longs for 
him to the last which loses, all change of lights from his 
midday to his moonrise, all his foreknowledge of evil 
things and good, all glad and sad hours of his night- ' ; i 
watches, all the fear and ardour which feels and fights 
against tke advent of his difference and dawn of his 
division, all agonies and consolations that embitter and 
allay the wounds of his mortal hour ; the pains of 
breach and death, the songs and visions of the wilderness 
of his penance, the wood of desolation made beautifiil and 
bitter by the same remembrance, haunted by shadows of 
the same hours for sorrow and for solace, and beyond all 
the light of the unaccomplished hour which missed its 
chance in one life to meet it in another where the 
sundered spirits revive into reunion ; all these things are here 
done into words and sung into hearing of men as they 
never were till no^ With a most noble and tender power 
all forms and colours of the world without are touched

of an imperial work? In the sonnet called <title>"Love- 
Sweetness "</title> there is the very honey of pure passion, the 
expression and essence of its highest thought and wisdom ; 
and in that called <title>" He and I,"</title> the whole pain and 
mystery of growing change. Even Shelley never expressed

T sonorous fluctuation of its measiure, a fiill tide under a 
full moon, of passion lit and led by memory to and fro 
beneath fiery and showery skies of past and future, has 
such depth and weight in its moving music that the echo 
of it is as a sea-shell in the mind's ear for ever. Observe 
the glorious change of note from the delicate colour of

the second stanza to the passionate colour of the third ; 
the passage from soft bright symbols to the actual fire of 
vision and burning remembrance; from the shelter of 
soul under soul and the mirror of tears whereia heart

growing incarnate upon the sight of memory ; and again 
to the deep dim witness and warning, the foresight and 
r^ret which lighten and darken the ways of coming life. 
This is perhaps, for style at once ample and simple, the 
noblest song of all; yet it is but one of many noble. 
Among these other^ I find none which clings by itself so 
long and dose to the mind as one outside their circle — 
the song of the sea-beach, called " Even So ; " it dies out 
with a suppressed sigh like the last breath or heartbeat of 
a yearning weak-winged wind "A Little While" is 
hea\y with all the honey of foretasted sorrow, sweeter in 
its aftertaste than the joy resigned, with a murmur beyond 
music in its speech. The perfect pity of the two last lines 
has Uie touch on it of plain truth and patience ; 

<quote>" I'll tell thee when the end is come

In <title>" Plighted Promise "</title> and <title>" Love- Lily "</title> the white flame 
of delight breathes and trembles in a subder air, with a 
sure and fauldp ss charm of motion. I like the first stanza 
of <title>"Sudden Light"</title> better than the second and third, 
admirably as they are fEishioned and set to the music of 
the thought : they have less seeming effusion of an instant 
insuppressible sense of memory; and the touches of colour 
and odour and sound in it are almost too fine in their

harmony to be matched with any later. There is not a 
more delicate note of magic nature in these poems. The 
tremulous ardour of <title>" Penumbra "</title> is another witness to 
the artist's mastery of hand ; the finest nerves of life are 
finely touched ; the quiver and ache of soul and senses 
to which all things are kindled and discoloured by half 
morbid lights of emotion give a burning pulse of melody 
to the verses. The same fear or doubt which here is 
attired in fancies of feverish beauty finds gentler utterance, 
again outside this circle, in <title>" A New Year's Burden ; "</title> the 
tone and colour have alwa3rs a fresh and suie harmony. 
Four poems in a different key firom such songs are <title>" The 
Sea-Limits,"</title> <title>" A Young Fir- Wood,"</title> <title>" The HoneysucUe,"</title> 
<title>" The Woodspurge \ "</title> not songs, but studies of spirit and 
thought, concrete and perfect The first of these has the 
solemn weight and depth in it of living water, and a 
sound like the speech of the sea when the wind is silent. 
The very note of that world-old harmony is caught and 
cast into words. 

<quote>" Consider the sea's listless chime : 
Time's self it is, made audible :

This little verse also has the

which <quote>" is the sea's end ; "</quote> it too is a living thing with an 
echo beyond reach of the sense, its chord of sound one 
part of the multiform unity of mutual inclusion in which

measurable and imperishable. The other three of these 
studies have something of the same air and flavoiu: : 
their keen truthfiilit^ss and subtle sincerity touch the 
same springs and kindle the same pulses of thought. 
The passionate accuracy of sense half blunted and 
half whetted by obsession and possession of pain is given 
in <title>"The Woodspurge"</title> with a bitterly beautiful exactitude.</p>

<p>In all the glorious poem built up of all these poems 
there is no great quality more notable than the sweet and 
sovereign unity of perfect spirit and sense, of fleshly form 
and intellectual fire. This Muse is as the woman praised 
in the divine words of the poet himself, 

<quote>" Whose speech Truth knows not from her thought 
Nor Love her body from her souL" </quote>

And if not love, how then should judgment? for love and 
judgment must be one in those who would look into such 
high and lovely things. No scrutiny can distinguish nor 
sentence divorce the solid spiritual truth from the bodily 
beauty of the poem, the very and visible soul from the 
dazzling veil and vesture of fair limbs and features. 
There has been no work of the same pitch attempted 
since Dante sealed up his youth in the sacred leaves of 
the <title>" Vita Nuova ; "</title> and this poem of his namechild and

sacred to the fame of a father made again illustrious in 
his children, which will be cherished with a warm 
reverence by all heedful students. The poem of " Dante 
at Verona '' stands apart among the rest with a crown on 
it of the like consecration, as perhaps the loftiest monument 
of all raised by the devotion of a race of genius for 
two generations of noble work and love. All incidents 
and traditions of the great poet's exile are welded together 
in fusion of ardent verse to forge a memorial as of carven 
gold. The pure plain ease and force of narrative style 
melt now and then into the fire of a sad rapture, a glory 
of tragedy lighting the whole vision as with a funereal 
and triumphal torch. Even the words of that letter in 
which Dante put away from him the base conditions of 
return — ^words matchless among all that ever a poet found 
to speak for himself, except only by those few supreme 
words in which Milton replied to the mockers of his 
blindness — even these are worthily recast in the mould 
of English verse by the might and cimning of this workman's 
hand. Witness the original set against his 
version. </p>

<quote xml:lang="la">" Non est haec via redeandi ad patriam, Pater mi ; sed si alia

<p>So wrote Dante in <date when="1316">1316</date> ; now partly rendered into 
English to this effect : —

<quote>" That since no gate led, by God's will. 
To Florence, but the one whereat 
The priests and money-changers sat, 
He still would wander : for that still, 
Even through the body's prison-bars, 
His soul possessed the sun and stars."</quote>

These and the majestic lines which follow them as 
comment have the heart of that letter in them ; the letter 
which we living now cannot read without the sense of a 
double bitterness and sweetness in its sacred speech, so 
lamentably and so gloriously applicable to the loftiest 
heir of Dante's faith and place ; of his faith as patriot, of 
his place as exile. It seems that the same price is still 
fixed for them to pay who have to buy with it the inheritance 
of sun and stars and the sweetest truths, and all 
generations of time, and the love and thanks and ' 
passionate remembrance of all faithful men for ever. </p>

<p>This poem is sustained throughout at the fit height 
with the due dignity; nothing feeble or jarring disturbs 
its equality of exultation. The few verses of bitter 
ardour which brand as a prostitute the conunonweal 
which has become a common wrong, the common 
goddess deformed into a common harlot, show a 
force of indignant iimagination worthy of a great poetic 
satirist, of Byron and Hugo in their worst wrath. The 
brief pictiu-es of the courtly life at Verona between 
women and rhymesters, jester and priests, have a living 
outline and colour ; and the last words have the weight 
in them of time's own sentence.

<p>No words could more fitly wind up the perfect weft 
of a poem throughout which the golden thread of 
Dante's own thought, the hidden light of his solitude at 
intervals between coiurt-play and justice-work, gleams 
now and again at each turn of the warp till we feel as 
though a new remnant of that great spirit's leaving had 
been vouchsafed us. </p>

<p>Another poem bearing the national mark upon it may 
be properly named with this ; the <title>" Last Confession."</title> Its 
tragic hold of truth and grasp of passion make it worthy 
to bear witness to the writer's inheritance of patriotic 
blood and spirit. Its literal dramatic power of detail and 
composition is a distinctive test of his various wealth and 
energy of genius. This great gift of positive reality, here 
above all things requisite, was less requisite elsewhere, 
and could not have been shown to exist by any proof 
derivable from his other poems ; though to any students 
of his designs and pictures the admirable imion of this 
inventive fidelity to whatever of fact is serviceable to 
the truth of art with the infinite affluence and gracious 
abundance of imagination must be familiar enough ; the 
subtle simplicity of perception which keeps sight always 
of ideal likelihood and poetical reason is as evident in 
his most lyrical and fanciful paintings as in Giorgione's 
or Carpaccio's. Without the high instinct and fine 
culture of this quality such a poem as We now have in 
sight could not have been attempted. The plain heroism 
of noble naked nature and coherent life is manifest firom 

<pb num="75"/>

the first delicate detail to the last The simple agony of 
memory inflames every line with native colour. A boyish 
patriot in hiding from the government finds a child 
forsaken in time of famine by her parents, saves and 
supports her, sets his heart towards hers more and more 
with the growth of years, to find at last the taint upon 
her of a dawning shame, of indifference and impurity — 
the hard laugh of a harlot on her lips, and in her bearing 
the dull contempt of a harlot for love and memory. 
Stabbed and stung through by this sudden show of the 
snake's fang as it turns upon the hand which cherished 
it, he slays her ; and even in his hour of maityrdom, 
djring of wounds taken in a last fight for Italy, is haunted 
by the lovely &ce and unlovely laugh of the girl he had 
put out of reach of shame. But the tender truth and 
grace, the living heat and movement of the tragedy 
through every detail, the noble choice and use of incident, 
make out of this plain story a poem beyond price. 
Upon each line of drawing there has been laid the strong 
and loving hand of a great artist — and specially a supreme ^ 
painter of fa ir women. In the study of the growing gi3 C-T ^ 
the glories of sculpture and painting are melted into one, 
and every touch d^es divine service ;

the <quote>"deep-serried locks,"</quote> the roimded clinging fingertips,

Between the water and the willow-leaves, 
And the shade quivers till he wins the light. "</quote></p> 

<p>In what poet's work shall we find a touch of more 
heavenly beauty, a nobler union of truth and chann? 
and in what painter's a statelier and sweeter mastery of 
nature than here ? 

<quote>" Her body bore her neck as the tree's stei§ 
Bears the top branch : and as the branch sustains 
The flower of the year's pride, her high neck bore 
Her face made wonderful vrith night and day."</quote></p>

<p>The purest pathos of all is in the little episode of the 
broken figure cjf Love, given to the child by her preserver, 
and the wound of its dart on her hand ; nothing 
in conception or in application could be tenderer or 
truer ; nothing more glorious in its horror than the fancy 
of heaven changing at its height before the very face of a 
spirit in paradise, with no reflection of him left on it : 

<quote>" Like a pool that once gave back 
Your image, but now drowns it and is clear 
Again, — or like a sun bewitched, that bums 
Your shadow from you, and still shines in sight."</quote></p>

<p>Admirable as it is throughout for natural and moral 
colour, the poem is completed and crowned for eternity 
by the song set on the firont of it as a wreath on a bride's 
hair, of which I can hardly say whether tlie Italian or the 
English form be the more divine. The miraculous faculty 
of transfusion which enables the cupbearer to pour this 
wine of verse from the golden into the silver cup without 
spilling was never before given to man. All Mr. 
Rossetti's translations bear the same evidence of a power 
not merely beyond reach but beyond attempt of other

artists in language. Wonderful as is the proof of it shown 
by his versions of Dante and his fellows, of Villon's and 
other ballad-songs of old France, the capacity of 
recasting in £J3glish an Italian poem of his own seems to me 
more wonderful ; and what a rare and subtle piece of 
work has been done here they only can appreciate who 
have tried carefully and failed utterly to refashion in one 
language a sonf thrown off in another. This is the kind 
of test which stamps the supremacy of an artist, answering 
in poetry to the subtlest successes of the same hand 
in painting. Whether or not there be now living a 
ma^er in colours who can match the peculiar triumphs 
of its touch, there is assuredly no master fh words. The 
melodies of these in their Italian form can never die out 
of the ear and heart they have once pierced with their 
keen and sovereign sweetness. This song would sutnce 
to redeem the whole story from the province of pain, 
even though the poet had not left upon us the natural 
charm of that hope which comes in with death, that the 
woman grown hard and bad was indeed no less a lie, an 
error, a spectral show, than the laughing ghost of her 
forged by bodily pain and recollection.</p>

<p>By this poem we may set for contrast, in witness of 
the artist's clear wide scope of work and power, the i 
<title>" Burden of Nineveh ; "</title> a study of pure thought and high j 
meditation, perhaps for sovereignty of language and strong j 
grasp of spirit the greatest of his poems. The contem- '

indeed, having wings and eyes as an eagle's. The solemn 
and splendid metre, if I mistake not, is a new instrument 
of music for English hands. In those of its fashioner it

makes harmonies majestic as any note of the heights or 
depths of natural sound. No highest verse can excel the 
mighty flow and chiming force of its continuous modulation, 
bearing on foamless waves of profound song its 
flock of winged thoughts and embodied visions. We hear 
in it as it were for once the sound of time's soundless 
feet, feel for once the beat of his unfelt wings in their 
passage through unknown places, and ctnturies without 
form and void. Echoes and gleams come with it fix)m 
<quote>" the dark backward and abysm "</quote> of dateless days ; a 
sighing sound from the graves of gods, a wind through 
the doors of death which opened on the early world. The

by the afterlight of thought Of the harmonious

An4 what more august and strenuous passion of thought 
was ever clothed in purple of more imperial speech than 
conswnmates and concludes the poem ? as, dreaming of a 
chance by which in the far future this God, found again 
a relic in a long ruined city, might be taken for the God 
of its mhabitants, the thinker comes to find in it indeed 
" the God of this world " and no dead idol, but a living 
deity and very present strength ; having wings, but not to 
fly with ; and eyes, but not to look up with ; bearing a 
written witness and a message engraved of which he knows 
not, and cannot read it ; crowned, but not for honour ; 
brow-bound with a royal sign, of oppression only and 
contraction ; firm of foot, but resting the weight of its 
trust on clay : — 

<quote>" O Nineveh, was this thy God, 
Thine also, mighty Nineveh ?" </quote>

A certain section of Mr. Rossetti's work as poet and as 
painter may be classed under the head of sacred art : and 
this section comprises much of his most exquisite and 
especial work. Its religious quality is singular and 
personal in kind; we cannot properly bracket it with any 
other workman's. The fire of feeling and imagination 
which feeds it is essentially Christian, and is therefore 
formally and spiritually Catholic It has nothii^ of 
rebellious Protestant personality, nothing of the popular 
compromise of sentiment which in the hybrid jargon of 
a school of hybrids we may call liberalized Christianism. 
The influence which plainly has passed over the writer's 

<pb num="80"/>
<fw type="pageNum">80</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

mind, attracting it as by charm of sound or vision, 
byspell of colour or of dream, towards the Christian foims 
and images, is in the main an influence from the 
mythologic side of the creed. It is from the sandbanks of 
tradition and poetry that the sacred sirens have sung to 
this seafarer. This divides him at once from the passionate 
evangelists of positive belief and from the artists upon 
whom no such influence has fallen in any comparable 
degree. There are two Hving and leading writers of high 
and diverse genius whom any student of their work — 
utterly apart as their ways of work lie — may and must, 
without prejudice or presumption, assume to hold fest, 
with a force of personal passion, the radical tenet of 
Christian faith. It is as difficult for a reasonable reader 
to doubt the actual and positive adherence to Christian 
doctrine of the Protestant thinker as of the Catholic 
priest; to doubt that faith in Christ as God — a tough, 
hard, vital faith which can bear at need hard stress of 
weather and hard thought — dictated <title>"A Death in the 
Desert "</title> or <title>" Christmas Eve and Easter Day,"</title> as to doubt 
that it dictated the <title>"Apologia"</title> or <title>" Dream of Gerontius : "</title> 
though neither in the personal creed set forth by Mr. 
Browning nor in the clerical creed delivered by Dr. 
Newman do we find apparent or flagrant — however they 
may lurk, tacit and latent, in the last logical expression 
of either man's theories— the viler forms and more 
hideous outcomes of Christianity, its more brutal aspects 
and deadlier consequences ; a happy default due rather 
to nobility of in^inct than to ingenuity of evasion. Now 
the sacred art of Mr. Rossetti, for all its Christian colouring, 
has actually no more in common with the spirit of 

<pb num="81">
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">81</fw>

either than it has with the semi-Christianity of <title>" In 
Metioriam"</title> or the demi-semi-Christianity of <title>"Dipsychus."</title> 
It has no trace, on the other hand, of the fretful and 
fruitless prurience of soul which would fain grasp and 
embrace and enjoy a creed beyond its power of possession ; 
no letch after Gods dead or unborn, such as vexes 
the weaker nerves of barren brains, and makes pathetic 
the vocal lips of sorrowing scepticism and <quote>" doubt that 
deserves to believe."</quote> As little can it be likened to another form- 
of bastard belief, anotfier cross-breed between 
faith and unfaith, which has been fostered in ages of 
doi4)t ; a ghost raised rather by fear than love ; by fear 
of a dead God as judge, than by love of a dead God as 
comforter. The hankering and restless habit of half 
fearful retrospect towards the unburied corpses of old 
creeds which, as we need not Shelley's evidence to know, 
infected the spiritual life and disturbed the intellectual 
force of Byron, is a mirage withotit attraction for this 
traveller ; that spiritual calenture of Christianity is a 
sickness unknown to his soul ; nor has he ever suffered from 
the distemper of minds fretted and worried by gnatstings 
and fleabites of belief and unbelief till the whole lifeblood 
of the intellect is enfeebled and inflamed. In a later poet, 
whose name as yet is far enough from inscription on the 
canonical roll of converts, there was some trace of a 
seeming recrudescence of faith not unhke yet not like 
Byron's. The intermittent Christian reaction apparently 
perceptible in Baudelaire was more than half of it mere 
repulsion from the philanthropic optimism of sciolists in 
whose eyes the whole aim or mission of things is to make 
the human spirit finally comfortable. Contempt of such

<fw type="pageNum">82</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

facile free-thinking, still more easy than free, took in him 
at times the form of apparent reversion to cast creeds ; 
as though the spirit should seek a fiery refuge in the good 
old hell of the faithful from the watery new paradise of 
liberal theosophy and ultimate amiability of all things.
<note num="1"> It is remarkable that Baudelaire always kept in mind that 
Christianity, like other religions which have a broad principle of 
popular life in them, was not and could not be a creature of 
philanthropy or philotheism, but of church and creed ; and this gives its 
peculiar savour and significance to the Christian infusion in some of 
his poems ; for such recollection is too rare in an age and country 
where semi-Christian sentiment runs loose and babbles aloud. </note> 
Alone among the higher atists of his age, Mr. Rossetti 
has felt and given the mere physical charm of Christianity, 
with no admixture of doctrine or of doubt. Here as in 
other things he belongs, if to any school at all, to that of 
the great Venetians, fte takes the matter in hand with 
the thorough comprehension of Tintoretto or Veronese, 
with their thorough subjection of creed and history to. the 
^ primary purpose of art and proper bearing of a picture. 
He works after the manner of Titian painting his 
Assumption with an equal hand whether the gu-1 exalted 
into goddess be Mary or Ariadne : but his instinct is too 
masterly for any confusion or discord of colours; and 
hence comes the spiritual charm and satisfaction of his 
sacred art In this class of his poems the first place and 
the fairest palm belong to the <title>" Blessed DamozeL"</title> This 
paradisal poem, <quote>" sweeter than honey or the honeycomb,"</quote> 
has found a somewhat further echo than any of its early 
fellows, and is perhaps known where little else is known 
of its author's. The sweet intense impression of it must 
rest for life upon all spirits that ever once received it 

<pb num="83"/>
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">83</fw> 

into their depths, and hold it yet as a thing too dear and 
fair for praise or price. Itself the flower of a splendid 
youth, it has the special charm for youth of fresh first 
work and opening love ; <quote>" the dew of its birth is of the 
womb of the morning ;"</quote> it has the odour and colour of 
cloudless air, the splendour of an hour without spot. 
The divine admixtures of earth which humanize its 
heavenly passion have the flavour and bloom upon thfem 
of a maiden beauty, the fine force of a pure first sunrise. 
No poem shows more plainly #ie strength and wealth of 
the workman's lavish yet studious hand. One sample in 
witness of this wealth, and in evidence of the power of 
choice and persistent search after perfection which 
enhance its price, may be cited ; though no petal should 
be plucked out of this mystic rose for proof of its fragrance. 
The two final lines of the stanza describing the secret 
shrine of God have been reformed ; and the form first 
given to the world is too fair to be wholly forgotten : — 

<quote>" Whose lamps tremble continually 
With prayer sent up to God, 
And where each need^ revealed, expects 
Its patient period: "</quote></p>

<p>Wonderful though the beauty may be of the new imagination, 
that the spirits standing there at length will see 
their <quote>" old prayers, granted, melt each like a little cloud,"</quote> 
there is so sweet a force in the canoelled phrase that some 
students might grudge the loss, and feel that, though a 
diamond may have supplanted it, a ruby has been plucked 
out of the golden ring. Nevertheless, the complete 
circlet shines now witli a more solid and flawless 
excellence of jewels and of setting. The sweetness and pathos 

<!-- G2 -->

<fw type="pageNum">84</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

and gracious radiance of the poem have been praised by 
those who have not known or noted all the noble care 
spent on it in rejection and rearrangement of whatever 
was cjude or lax in the first cast ; but the breadth and 
sublimity which ennoble its brightness and beauty of 
fancies are yet worthier of note than these. What higher 
imagination can be found in modem verse than this ? 

<quote>"From the fixed place of heaven she saw 
Time like ajndse shake fierce 
Through all the worlds,"</quote></p>

<p>This grandeur of scale and sweep of spirit give greatness 
of style to poetry, as well as sweetness and brightness.
 These qualities, together with the charm of fluent 
force and facile power, are apparent in all Mr. Rossetti's 
work j but its height of pitch and width of scope give 
them weight and price beyond their own. 

<p>Another poem, based like this on the Christian sentiment 
of woman- worship, is worthy of a place next it In 
the hymn headed <title>" Ave "</title> the finest passage is that on the 
life of the Virgin after the death of Christ ; a subject 
handled by the painter as well as by the poet Indeed, 
of the two versions, that in colour is even the lovelier and 
more memorable to all who may have seen it for gentle 
glory of treatment — for the divine worn face of the 
Mother, seen piteously sacred in the light struck by the 
beloved disciple, as the thick purple twilight steeping the 
city roofs and the bare hill- side which saw the stations of 
the cross fills with pale coloured shadows the still small 
chamber where she sits at work for her Son's poor. The 
soft fervour and faultless keeping of the poem give it that 

<pb num="85"/>
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">85</fw> 

final grace of a complete unity of spirit and style which 
is the seal of sacred art at its highest.</p>

<p>No choicer sample of Mr. Rossetti's delicate mastery
of language — of his exquisite manner of speech, subtle 
and powerful and pliant to all necessities of thought — 
can be found than the verses invoking Love as the god 
of sleep to guide the shadow of the lover who invokes 
him to the dreams of the woman beloved. The grace of 
symbol and type in this poem has something of the 
passionate refinement of Shelley's. There are many 
several lines and turns of phrase in this brief space of 
which any least one would suffice to decide the rank of a 
poet : and the fine piuity of its passion gives just colour 
enough to the clouds and music enough to the murmurs 
of the deep dreamland in which it moves.</p>

<p>With this poem we may class one sadder and as 
sweet, <title>"The Stream's Secret ; "</title> the thread of thought is 
so fine, yet woven into so full a web of golden fancies 
and glowing dreams, that few will follow it at first sight ; 
but when once unwound and rewoven by the reader's 
study of it, he will see the whole force and beauty of all 
its many byway beauties and forces.</p>

<p>The highest form of ballad requires from a poet ar 
once narrative power, lyrical, and dramatfc ; it must hold 
in fiision these three faculties at once, or fail of its mark: , 
it must condense the large loose fluency of romantic tale- , 
telling into tight and intense brevity ; it must give as in 
summary the result and extract of events and emotions, 
without the exhibition of their gradual change and growth 
which a romance of the older type or the newer must lay 
open to us in order ; it must be swifter of step and 

<pb num="86"/>
<fw type="pageNum">86</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

sharper of stroke than any other form of poetry. The 
wTiter of a first-rate tragic ballad must be yet more select 
in his matter and terse in his treatment of what he selects 
from the heap of possible incident, than Chaucer in the <!-- Referencing author and title: <bibl>? -->
compilation of his <title>" Knight's Tale "</title> from the epic romance 
of Boccaccio, or Morris in the sculpture of his noble 
master-poem, <title>" The Lovers of Gudrun,"</title> from the unhewn 
rock of a half-formed history or a half-grown legend. 
Ballads have been cut out of such poems as these, even 
as they were carven out of shapeless chronicles. There 
can be no pause in a ballad, and no excess ; nothing that 
flags, nothing that overflows ; there must be no waste of 
a word or a minute in the course of its rapid and fiery 
motion. Even in our affluent ballad literature there is 
no more triumphant sample of the greatness that may be 
won by a poem on these conditions than we find in the 
ballad of <title>" Sister Helen."</title> The tragic music of its measure, 
the swift yet solemn harmonies of dialogue, and burden, 
hold in extract the very heart of a tragedy, the burning 
essence distilled from <quote>" Hate born of Love, and blind as 
he."</quote> Higher effect was never wrought out of the old 
traditions of witchcraft ; though the manner of sorcery 
here treated be one so well known as the form of destroying 
a man by melting a waxen effigy of him before a 
continuous flame for the space of three days and nights, 
after which the dissolution of the fleshly body keeps time 
to a minute with that of the waxen. A girl forsaken by 
her high-bom lover turns to sorcery for help in her revenge 
on him ; and with the end of the third day come 
three suppliants, the father and the brothers of the betrayer, 
to whom he has shown the secret of his wasting

agony, if haply they may bring him back not life but 
forgiveness at her hands. Dying herself of anguish with 
him and with the molten figure of her making, she will 
remit nothing of her great revenge ; body and soul of both 
shall perish in one fourfold death : and her answers pass, 
ever more and more bitter and ardent, through tlie harmless 
mouthpiece of a child. How the tragic effect is enforced 
and thrown out into fiery relief by this intervention 
of the boy-biDther it needs no words, where none would be 
adequate, to say. I account this one of the artist's very 
highest reaches of triumphant poetry ; he has but once in 
this book matched it for pathos, and but once for passion : 
for pathos in <title>" Jenny,"</title> for passion in <title>" Eden Bower."</title> It 
is out of all sight or thought of comparison the greatest 
ballad in nK)dem English ; and perhaps not very far 
below it, and certainly in a high place among the attempts 
in that way of living Englishmen, we might class Mr. 
George Meredith's pathetic and splendid poem of 
<title>" Margaret's Bridal-Eve."</title> </p>

<p>There is exquisite grace of colour and sweetness in 
<title>" The Staflf and Scrip,"</title> with passaged that search and 
sound pure depths of sentiment, and with interludes of 
perfect drawing'; witness the sweet short study of the 
Queen sitting by her loom : but the air of the poem is 
too remote and refined for any passionate interest.</p> 

<p>The landscape of <title>" Stratton Water "</title> is as vivid and 
thorough as any ballad can show ; but some may wish 
it had been more or less of a compromise in style between 
old and new : it is now a study after the old manner too 
dose to be no closer. It is not meant for a perfect and 
absolute piece of work in the old Border fashion, such as 

<pb num="88"/>

were those glorious rescripts, full of the fiery ease which is 
the life of such poetry, which Surtees of Mainsforth passed 
off even upon Scott as genuine ; and yet it is so &r a 
copy that it seems hardly well to have gone so far and no 
further. On this ground Mr. Morris has a firmer tread 
than the great artist by the light of whose genius and 
kindly guidance he put forth the firstfruits of his work, as 
I did afterwards. In his first book the ballad of <title>" Welland 
River,"<title> the Christmas carol in <title>"The Land East of the 
Sun and West of the Moon,"</title> and that other, his most 
beautiful carol, printed with music in a volume of sacred 
verse, are examples of flawless work in the pure early 
manner. Any less absolute and decisive revival of 
mediaeval form by inspiration of returning lifeblood and 
measured breath of life into the exact type and mould of 
ancient art rouses some sense of failure by excess or default
 of resemblance. This positive note of the past is 
not quite caught here, and the note struck is too like it to 
take its place without discord.</p>

<p>There is a singular force and weight of impression in 
the <title>" Card-Dealer "</title> which give it a distinct and eminent 
place among these lesser poems. The sharpness of 
symbol and solidity of incarnation with which the idea 
is invested bring it so dose to us that the mere type itself 
assumes as it were a bodily interest over and above its 
spirit and significance ; and the tragic colour and mystic 
movement of the poem are fitted to the dim splendour 
and vague ardour of life in it ; whether the dealer be 
fortune or passion or ambition, pleasure or feme or any 
desire of man's, we see her mistress of the game in that 
world of shadows and echoes which is hers if ours.

Without the date appended, we might have guessed that 
the little cabinet poem called <title>" My Sister's Sleep "</title> was an 
early study. It has the freshness and clearness of first 
youth, with something of the hardness of growing outlines ; 
the bodily form of verse has not yet learnt to melt ' 
and flow by instinct into the right way ; yet with this 
slight sharpness and crudity there is a grace of keen 
sincerity and direct force which gives proof of no student's 
hand, but a workman's recognisable as bom into the 
guild of masters. The fourth and three following stanzas 
have a brightness and intensity of truth, a fine and tender 
vigour of sentiment, admirable at any age ; and the last 
have an instant weight of pathos and clear accuracy of 
beauty, full of prophecy and promises. In the same 
short-lived magazine into which the first flowerage of 
many eminent men's work was cast with such liberal and 
fruitful hands, there was another early poem of this their 
leader's and best man which he might as well have 
gathered into his harvest ; a delicate and subtle study of 
religious passion, with the colour and perfume in it of the 
choral air of a cathedral, lit with latticed glories of saints, 
and tremulous with low music of burning prayers ; the 
mystery of sense and ardour Of soul in an hour made 
drunken with the ^dne of worship were wrought into 
expression of bright and sensitive words, full of the fiery 
peace of prayer and sightless vision of faith. This little 
sacred picture of the Father Hilary should have been 
here reframed, if only for the fine touches of outer things 
passing by as a wind upon the fervent spirit in its dream. 
Besides, it has its place and significance among the 
author's studies in the Christian style, near some of those 

<ob num="90"/>
<fw type="pageNum">90</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

earlier works, so full of his special grace and spiritual 
charm, which belong to the same period, if not beside the 
highest of his sacred designs, such as the Passover and 
Magdalene here as it were engraved and put forth in 
print among the sonnets for pictures. All these are most 
noble, and give once more a magnificent proof of his 
power to bend and mould, to inflame and invigorate, to 
carve and colour the dead forms of words with a shaping 
and animating life. Among them all the most utterly 
delightful to me is that on Giorgione's divine and trans- 
^ cendant pastoral in the Louvre : which actually attains 
to the transfusion of a spirit that seemed incommunicable 
from one master's hand even to another's. In the verse 
as on the canvass there is the breathless breath of 
overmuch delight, the passion of overrunning pleasure which 
quivers and aches on the very edge of heavenly tears — 
<quote>"tears of perfect moan"</quote> for excess of unfathomable 
pleasure and burden of inexpressible things only to be 
borne by Gods in heaven ; the sweet and sovereign 
oppression of absolute beauty and the nakedness of burning 
life ; the supreme pause of soul and sense at the climax 
of their consummate noon and high tide of being; glad 
and sad and sacred, unsearchable and natural and strange. 
Of the sonnets on the writer's own pictures and designs 
I think that on Pandora to be the most perfect and exalted, 
as the design is among his mistiest in its godlike 
terror and imperial trouble of beauty, shadowed by the 
smoke and fiery vapour of winged and fleshless passions 
crowding from the casket in spires of flame-lit and curling 
cloud round her fatal face and mourning veil of hair. The 
sonnets on Cassandra translate with apt and passionate 

<pb num="91"/>
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">91</fw> 

choice of words the scheme of his greatest tragic design, 
his fullest and most various in vital incident and high 
truth of heroic life. The grand sonnet <title>" on refusal of 
aid between nations "</title> shows yet a fresh side and a most 
noble aspect of his great and manifold genius ; its severe 
emotion and grave loveliness of ardent anger set a mark 
on it as of Dante's justice and judgment <title>"Autumn 
Idleness "</title> is a splendid study of landscape, for breadth of 
colour and solemn brightness of vision worthy to stand 
by those great symbolic landscapes seen in the <title>" House 
of Life,"</title> such as <title>"Barren Spring"</title> and <title>"The Hill 
Summit ; "</title> and in <title>" Beauty and the Bird "</title> we have a 
sample of the painter's gladdest colour and sweetest tone 
of light His full command of that lyric sentiment and 
power which give to mediaeval poetry its clear particular 
charm is plain alike from the ending given to the <quote>" old 
song "</quote> of Ophelia and from the marvellous versions of 
Villon's and other French songs. The three sweetest of 
that great poet's who was th? third singer of the Middle 
Ages and first vocal tongue of the dumb painful people 
in its agony and mirth and shame and strength of heart, 
are here recast in English gold of equal weight The 
very cadence of Villon's matcljless ballad of the ladies of 
old time is caught and returned. The same exquisite 
exactitude of translation is notable in <title>" John of Tours "</title> — 
the old provincial song long passed from mouth to mouth 
and at last^ preserved with all its breaks and lapses of 
sweet rough metre by Gerard de Nerval His version of 
Dante's divinest episode, that of Francesca, I take to be 
the supreme triumph of translation possible ; fcr what, 
after so many failures, — ^Byron's the dismallest £iilure of

all, and worst imaginable instance of perversion — could 
be hoped of any new attempt ? But here the divine verse 
seems actuaUy to fell of itself into a new mould, the 
exact shape and size of the first — to be poured firom one 
cup into another without spilling one drop of nectar. 
Nay, so far beyond other men's is this poef s power of 
transfusion that as though to confute the Italian proverb 
against the treasons of translators he has wellnigh 
achieved the glory of reproducing a few lines even of 
Sappho, by welding two fi-agments into one song, melting 
two notes into one chord of verse. But though the 
sweet life and colour be saved and renewed, no man can 
give again in full that ineffable glory and grace as of 
present godhead, that subtle breath and bloom of very 
heaven itself, that dignity of divinity which informs the 
, most passionate and piteous notes of the unapproachable 
poetess with such grandeur as would seem impossible to 
such passion. Here is a delicious and living music, but 
here is not — ^what can nowhere be — the echo of that 
imimaginable song, with its pauses and redoubled notes and 
returns and falls of sound, as of honey dropping firom 
heaven — ^as of tears, and fire, and seed of life — ^which 
though but run over and repeated in thought pervades 
the spirit with <quote>" a sweet possessive pang."</quote> That apple 
<quote>" atop on the topmost twig "</quote> of the tree of life and song 
remains unreachable by any second hand, untastable 
by any later lip for ever ; never out of sigjit of men's 
memory, never within grasp of man's desire ; the apple 
which not Paris but Apollo gave to her whose glory has 
outlived her goddess, and whose name has been set above 
hers: —

<p>Among the lesser poems of this volume <title>"The Portrait"</title>
holds a place of honour in right of its earnest beauty of 
thought and rich simplicity of noble images. Above them 
all in reach and scope of power stands the poem of 
<title>" Jenny ;"</title> great among the few greatest works of the artist 
Its plain truth and masculine tenderness are invested with 
a natural array of thought and imagination which doubles 
their worth and force. Without a taint on it of anything 
coarse or trivial, without shadow or suspicion of any facile 
or vulgar aim at pathetic effect of a tragical or moral kind, 
it cleaves to absolute feet and reality closer than any 
common preacher or realist could come ; no side of the 
study is thrown out or thrown back into false hght or 
furtive shadow ; but the piuity and nobility of its high 
and ardent pathos are qualities of a moral weight and 
beauty beyond reach of any rivalry. A divine pity fills 
it, or a pity something better than divine ; the more just 
and deeper compassion of human fellowship and fleshly 
brotherhood. Here is nothing of sickly fiction or 
theatrical violence of tone. No spiritual station of 
command is assumed, no vantage-ground of outlook from 
hills of holiness or heights of moral indifference or 
barriers of hard contempt; no unction of facile tears is 
poured out upon this fallen golden head of a common 
woman ; no loose-tongued effusion of slippery sympathy, 
to wash out shame with sentiment And therefore is 
<quote>" the pity of it "</quote> a noble pity, and worth the paying ; a 
genuine sin-offering for intercession, pleading with fate 

<pb num="94"/>
<fw type="pageNum">94</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

for mercy without thought or purpose of pleading. The 
man whose thought is thus gloriously done into words is 
as other men are, only with a better brain and heart than 
the common, with more of mind and compassion, with 
better eye to see and quicker pulse to beat, with a more 
generous intellect and a finer taste of things; and his 
chance companion of a night is no ruined angel or 
selfinamolated sacrifice, but a girl who plies her trade like 
any other trade, without show or sense of reluctance or 
repulsion ; there is no hint that she was first made to fit 
better into a smoother groove of life, to run more easily 
on a higher line of being ; that anything seen in prospect 
or retrospect rebukes or recalls her fancy into any fairer 
field than she may reach by her present road. All the 
open soiurces of pathetic effusion to which a common 
shepherd of souls would have led the flock of his readers 
to drink and weep and be refreshed, and leave the medicinal 
wellspring of sentiment warmer and fuller from 
their easy tears, are here dried up. This poor hireling of 
the streets and casinos is professionally pitiable; the 
world's contempt of her fellow tradeswomen is not in 
itself groundless or unrighteous ; there is no need to raise 
any mirage about her as of a fallen star, a glorious wreck ; 
but not in that bitterest cry of Othello's own agony — <quote>" a 
suflferance panging as soul and body's severing"</quote> — was 
there a more divine heat of burning compassion than the 
high heart of a man may naturally lavish, as in this poem, 
upon such an one as she is. lago indeed could not 
share it, nor Roderigo ; the naked understanding cannot 
feel this, nor the mere fool of flesh apprehend it ; . but 
only in one or the other of these can all sense be dead of 
<quote>" the pity of it." </quote></p>

<p>Every touch of real detail and minute colour in the 
study serves to heighten and complete the finished picture 
which remams burnt in upon the eyes of our memory 
when the work is done. The clock ticking, the bird 
waking, the scratched pier-glass, the shaded lamp, give 
new relief as of very light and present sound to the 
spiritual side of the poem. How great and profound is 
the scope and power of the work on that side, I can offer 
no better proof than a reference to the whole; for no 
sample of this can be torn off or cut out Of the might 
of handiwork and simple sovereignty of manner which 
make it so triumphant a witness of what English speech 
can do, this one excerpt may stand in evidence : — 

<quote>" Except when'there may rise unsought 
Haply at times a passii^ thought 
Of the old days which seem to be 
Much older than any history 
That is written in any book ; 
When she would lie in fields and look 
Along the ground through the blown grass. 
And wonder where the city was, 
Far out of sight, whose broil and bale 
They told her then for a child's tale. 

" Jenny, you know the city now. 
A child can tell the tale there, how 
Some things, which are not yet enrolled 
In market -lists, are bought and sold 
Even till the early Sunday light. 
When Saturday night is market -night 
Everywhere, be it dry or wet. 
And market-night in the Haymarket."</quote></p>

<p>The simple sudden soimd of that plain line is as great 
and rare a thing in the way of verse, as final and superb 
a proof of absolute poetic power upon words, as any 

<pb num="96"/>
<fw type="pageNum">96</fw> <fw type="header">THE POEMS OF</fw>

man's work can show. As an imaginarive instance of 
positive and perfect nature, the whole train of thought 
evolved in the man's mind as he watches the head asleep 
on his knee is equal and incomparable ; the thought of 
a pure honest girl, in whom the same natural loves and 
likings shall run straight and bear fruit to honour, that in 
this girl have all run to seed of shame; the possible 
changes of chance that in their time shall bring fresh 
proof of the sad equality of nature and tragic identity of 
birthmark as of birthright in all souls bom, the remote 
conceivable justice and restitution that may some day 
strike the balance between varying lots and lives; the 
delicately beautiful and pitiful fency of the rose pressed 
in between the pages of an impure book; and the 
mightier fancy so grandly cast in words, of lust, alone, 
aloof, immortal, immovable, outside of death in the dark 
of things everlasting ; self-secluded in absorption of its 
own desire, and walled up from love or light as a toad 
in its stone wrapping ; and last, with the grey penetration 
of London dawn, the awakening of mind into live daylight 
of work, and farewell taken of the night and its 
follies, not without pity or thought of them.</p>

<p>The whole work is worthy to fill its place for ever as 
one of the most perfect and memorable poems of an age 
or generation. It deals with deep and common things ; 
with the present hoiu:, and with all time ; with that which 
is of the instant among us, and that which has a message 
for all souls of men ; with the outward and immediate 
matter of the day, and with the inner and immutable 
ground of human nature. Its plainness of speech and 
subject gives it power to touch the heights and sound the 

<pb num="97"/>
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">97</fw> 

dq)ths of tragic thought without losing the force of its 
hold and grasp upon the palpable truths which men often 
seek and cry out for in poetry, without knowing that these 
are only good when greatly treated, and that to artists who 
can treat them greatly all times and all truths are equal, 
and the present, though assuredly no worse, yet assuredly 
no better topic than the past. All the ineffably foolish 
jargon and jangle of criticasters about classic subjects 
and romantic, .remote or immediate interests, duties of 
the poet to face and handle this thing instead of that or 
his own age instead of another, can only serve to darken 
counsel by words without knowledge : a poet of the first 
order raises all subjects to the first rank, and puts the ^ 
life-blood of an equal interest into Hebrew forms or 
Greek, mediaeval or modem, yesterday or yesterage. 
Thus there is here just the same life-blood and breath of 
poetic interest in this episode of a London street and 
lodging as in the song of <title>" Troy Town "</title> and the song of 
<title>"Eden Bower; "</title> just as much, and no jot more. These 
two songs are the masterpieces of Mr. Rossetti's magni- - 
ficent lyric faculty. Full of fire and music smd movement, 
delicate as moonlight and passionate as sunlight, 
fresh as dawn and fine as air, sonorous as the motion of 
deep waters, the infallible verse bears up the spirit safe 
and joyous on its wide clearway. There is- a strength 
and breadth of style about these poems also which ennobles 
their sweetness and brightness, giving them a perfume that 
savours of no hotbed, but of hill-flowers that 
face the sea and the sunrise \ a colour that grows in no 
greenhouse, but such as comes with morning upon the 
mountains. They are good certainly, but they are also

great; great as no other man's work of the same age and 
country. Out of the beautiful old tradition of Helen, 
which tells of her oflfering on a shrine at Sparta of a cup 
modelled upon the mould of her own breast, the poet has 
carved a graven image of song as tangible and lovely as 
the oblation itself; and this cup he has filled with the 
wine of love and fire of destmction, so that in the Spartan 
. temple we feel a forecast of light and heat fix)m the fiiture 
' Trojan flame. These two poems have the fiery 
concentration and condensation of the ballad ; but they have a 
higher rapture of imagination, a more ardent affluence of 
coloiu: and strenuous dilation of spirit, than a ballad can 
properly contain ; their wings of words beat and bum at 
fuller expansion through a keener air. The song of Lilith 
has all the beauty and glory and force in it of the splendid 
creature so long worshipped of men as god or dreaded 
as devil; the voluptuous swiftness and strength, the 
supreme luxury of liberty in its measured grace and lithe 
melodious motion of rapid and revolving harmony; the 
subtle action and majestic recoil, the mysterious charm 
i as of somidless music that hangs about a serpent as it 
' stirs or springs. Never was nobler blood infiised into the 
veins of an old legend than into this of the first wife of 
Adam, changing shapes with the snake her lover, that in 
his likeness she may tempt the mother of men. The 
passion of the cast-ofi" temptress, in whose nets of woven 
hair all the souls are entangled of her rival's sons through 
all their generations, has such actual and instant flame of 
wrath and brilliance of blood and fragrance of breath in 
it, that we feel face to fiice the very vision of the old tale, 
and no symbol or shadow, but a bodily shape and a 

<pb num="99"/>
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">99</fw> 

fleshly charm, dominant in ear and eye. The tragic 
might of the myth, its fierce and keen significance, strikes 
through us sharpest at the end, as with the supreme 
sting of triumph and final fang of the transfigured 
serpent.</p>

<p>Had I time and room and skill, to whom all these 
are wanting, I would here at length try to say some 
passing word illustrative of the more obvious and the 
more intimate relations of this artist's work in verse and 
his work in painting ; between the poem of <title>" Jenny "</title> 
and the design called <title>" Found,"</title> where at early dawn the 
driver of a country cart finds crouching in London streets 
the figure of a girl once his betrothed, and stoops to lift 
with tender strength of love, and surprise of simple pity 
startled into fi-eshness of pain, the shuddering abased 
head with the golden ruin of its rich soiled hair, which 
cowers against a graveyard wall away from the light that 
rises beyond the paling lamps on bridge and river ; 
between the song of <title>"Troy Town"</title> and the picture of 
Helen, with Parian lace and mouth of ardent blossom, a 
keen red flower-bud of fire, fiiamed in broad gold of 
widespread locks, the sweet sharp smile of power set fast on 
her clear curved lips, and far behind her the dull flame of 
burning towers and light fi*om reddened heaven on dark 
sails of lurid ships ; between the early sacred poems and 
the early sacred designs of the author's Christian era, as 
for instance the <title>" Ave "</title> and the <title>" Girlhood of the Virgin,"</title> 
with its young grace and sincere splendour of spirit, the 
<title>" Staff and Scrip "</title> and the design of <title>" Fra Pace,"</title> the <!-- xml:lang -->

clothed in colours of heaven, with raiment dyed and

spun in the paradise of trust and thought ; between the 
romantic poems and the romantic designs, as for example 
<title>"Sister Helen"</title> and the <title>"Tune of 'Seven Towers/"</title> 
which have the same tone and tj'pe of tragic romance in 
their mediaeval touches and notes of passionate fancy ; 
between the poems of richer thought and the designs of 
riper form, works of larger insight and more strong decision, 
fruits of the mind at its fullest and the hand at its 
mightiest, as the <title>"Burden of Nineveh"</title> and the <title>"Sybil"</title> 
or <title>"Pandora."</title> The passage from a heaven of mere 
angels and virgins to the stronger vision of Venus Verticordia, 
of Helen cAcVroXir, <!-- Greek --> of Lilith and Cassandra, is a 
type of the growth of mind and hand to the perfect pow^r 
of mastery over the truth and depth of nature, the large 
laws of spirit and body, the mysteries and the majesties 
of very life ; whither the soul that has attained perceives, 
though it need reject no first feith and forsake no first 
love, though rather it include in a larger comprehension 
of embrace those old with these new graces, those creeds 
with this belief, that any garden of paradise on earth or 
above earth is but a little part of a great world, as every 
fancy of man's faith is a segment bf the truth of his nature, 
a splintered fragment of imiversal life and spuit of thought 
everlasting ; since what can he conceive or believe but 
it must have this of truth in it, that it is a veritable 
product of his own brain and outcome for the time of his 
actual being, with a place and a reason of its own for 
root and support to it through its due periods of life and 
change and death ? But to trace the passage from light 
into light and strength into strength, the march firom work 
on to work and triumph on to triumph, of a genius so full 

<pb num="101"/>
<fw type="header">DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</fw> <fw type="pageNum">101</fw>

of life and growth and harmonious exuberance of expansion, 
so loyal to rule of instinct and that natural order of 
art and thought whose service is perfect freedom ; to lay 
out a chart of its progress and mark down the lines of 
its advance ; this, high as the office would be and worthy 
die ambition, is not a possible task for criticism ; though 
what manner of rank a man may hold and what manner 
of work he may have to do in that rank, it is the business 
of criticism to see and say.</p>

<p>In every age there is some question raised as to its 
wants and powers, its strength and weakness, its great or 
small worth and work ; and in every age that question is 
waste of time and speech — of thought usually there is no 
waste, for the questioners have none to expend. There 
has never been an age that was not degenerate in the eyes 
of its own fools ; the yelp of curtailed foxes in every 
generation is the same. To a small soul the age which 
has borne it can appear only as an age of small souls ; 
the pigmy brain and emasculate spirit can perceive in its 
own time nothing but dwarfishness and emasculation. 
That the world has ever seen spirits of another sort, the 
poor heart of such creatures would fain deny and dares 
not ; but to allow that the world does now is insufferable ; 
at least they can <quote>"swagger themselves out of their own eyes "</quote>
into the fond belief that they are but samples of their 
puny time, overtopped in spiritual stature by the spirits 
of times past alone. But not by blustering denial or 
blustering assertion of an age's greatness will the question 
be decided whether the age be great or not Each century 
has seemed to some of its children an epoch of decadence 
and decline in national life and spiritual, in moral or

material glory \ each alike has heard the cry of degeneracy 
raised against it, the wail of emulous impotence set up 
against the weakness of the age ; Dante's generation and 
Shakespeare's, Milton's and Shelley's, have all been ages 
of poetic decay in their turn, as the age of Hugo is now ; 
there as here no great man was to be seen, no great 
work was to be done, no great cry was to be heard, no 
great impulse was to be felt, by those who could feel 
nothing, hear nothing, do nothing, and see nothing. To 
them the poor present has always been pitiable or danmable, 
the past which bore it divine. And other men than 
these have swelled the common cry of curs : BjTon, 
himself in his better moments a witness against his own 
words^ helped the fools of his hour to decry their betters 
and his own, by a pretence of wailing over the Augustan 
age of Anne, when <quote>" it was all Horace with us ; it is all 
Claudian now."</quote> His <emph rend="italic">now</emph> has become our <emph rend="italic">then</emph> and the 
same whine is raised in its honour ; for the cant of 
irritation and insincerity, hungry vanity and starving spite, can 
always be caught up and inherited by those who can inherit 
nothing of a strong man's but his weakness, of a 
wise man's but his folly 3 who can gather at a great man's 
board no sustenance from the meats and wines, but are 
proud to pilfer the soiled napkins and cracked platters 
from under his side-table. Whether there be any great 
work doing in our time, or any great man living, it is not 
worth while to debate ; but if there be not, it is certain 
that no man living can know it ; for to pass judgment 
worth heeding on any age and give sentence that shaU 
last on any generation, a man must himself be great ; and

be great enough to know and let us know it on better 
authority than a pigmy's ? Such champions as please may 
fight out on either side their battle of the sandbags and 
windbags between this hour and the next j I am content 
to assume, and am not careful to dispute in defence of 
the assumption, that the qu^ities which make men great 
and the work of men famous are now what they were, and 
will be what they are : that there is no progress and no 
degeneracy traceable from -^schylus <!-- Special character --> to Shakespeare, from 
Athenian sculptors to Venetian painters ; that the gifts of 
genius are diverse, but the quality is one \ and — though 
this be a paradox — that this quality does not wait till a 
man be dead to descend on him and belong to him ; 
that his special working power does not of necessity 
begin with the cessation of it, and that the dawn of his 
faculty cannot reasonably be dated from the hour of its 
extinction. If this paradox be not utterly untenable, it 
follows that dead men of genius had genius even when 
yet alive, and did not begin to be great men by ceasing 
to be men at all ; and that so far we have no cause to 
distrust the evidence of reason which proves us the 
greatness of men past when it proves to us by the same
 process of testimony the greatness of men present.</p>

<p>Here for example in the work of Mr. Rossetti, 
besides that particular colour and flavour which distinguishes 
each master's work from that of all other masters, 
and by want of which you may tell merely good work 
from wholly great work, the general qualities of all great 
poetry are separately visible and divisible ; strength, 
sweetness, affluence, simplicity, depth, light, harmony, ^ 
variety, bodily grace and range of mind and force of soul

and ease of flight, the scope and sweep of wing to impel 
the might and weight of thought through the air and light 
of speech with a motion as of mere musical impulse ; and 
' not less the live bloom of perfect words, warm as breath 
and fine as flower-dust, which lies light as air upon the 
parting of lyric leaves that open into song ; the irare and 
inefiable mark of a supreme singing power, an element 
too subtle for solution in any crucible of analysis, though 
its presence or absence be patent at a first trial to all who 
have a sense of taste. All these this poet has, and the 
mastery over all these which melts and fuses all into form 
and use ; the cunning to tmn his own gifts to service which 
is the last great apanage of great workmen. Colour and 
sound are servants of his thought, and his thought is 
servant of his will ; in him the will and the instinct are not^ 
two forces, but one strength \ are not two leaders, but one 
guide ; there is no shortcoming, no pain or compulsion 
in the homage of hand to soul The subject-matter of 
his work is always great and fit ; nothing trivial, nothing 
illicit, nothing unworthy the workmanship of a masterhand, 
is to be swept up from any comer of the floor; 
there is no misuse or waste of good work on stuff too 
light or hard to take the impression of his noble style. 
He builds up no statues of snow at the bidding of any 
fool, with the hand that can carve itself a godlike model 
in ivory or gold ; not though all the fools of the place 
and hour should recommend snow as the best material, 
for its softness and purity. Time and work and art are 
too precious to him and too serious to be spent on anything 
less than the best An artist worthy of the highest 
work will make his least work worthy of himself. In 

<pb num="105"/>

each line of labour which his spirit may strike into he will 
make his mark, and set his stamp on any metal he may 
take in hand to forge ; for he can strike into no wrong 
line, and take in hand no base metaL So equal a 
balance of two great gifts as we find in the genius of this 
artist is perhaps the greatest gift of all, as it is certainly 
the most singular. We cannot tell what jewels were lost 
to the treasure-house of time in that century of sonnets 
which held <quote>" the bosom-beats of Raffael ; "</quote> we can but 
gaess that they had somewhat, and doubt how nearly they 
had all, of his perfect grace and godhead of heavenly 
humanity. Even of the giant-god his rival we cannot be 
sure that his divine faculties never clashed or crossed 
each other to their mutual hindrance.</p>

<p>But here, where both the sister powers serve in the 
temple of one mind and impel the work of one hand, 
their manner of service is smooth, harmonious, perfect ; 
the splendid quality of painting and the subtie faculty of 
verse gain glory fi-om each other without taking, reign 
side by side with no division of empire, yet with no confusion 
of claims, with no invasion of rights. No tongue-
less painter or handless poet could be safer from the 
perils of mixed art ; his poems are not over pictorial or 
his pictures over poetical ; his poetry has not the less 
depth and reach and force and height of spirit proper to 
poetry, his painting has not the less might and skill, the 
less excellence of form and colour or masterdom of design 
and handiwork proper to painting, for the double glory of 
his genius. Which of the two great men in him, the painter 
or the poet, be the greater, only another artist equal to 
him on either hand and taintless of jealousy or misconceit

could say ivith authority worth a hearing ; and such a 
judge he is not likely to find. But wliat is his relative 
mnk among other men it needs no such rare union of 
ties to perceive. His place among the painters of his 
iiiy may be elsewhere debated and determined ; but 
and now the materials lie before us for deusion as 
is place among its poets. Of these there is but one 
whose name is already unamenable to any judg-
ment of the hour's ; whose supremacy, whether it be or 
lot a matter of question between insular and pro-
vincial circles of parasites or sectarians, is no more de-
ible before any graver tribunal than the motion of 
earth round the sun. Upon him, as upon two or 
-. other of the leaders of men in time past, the verdict 
me has been given before' his death. In out com- 
»n of men with men for worse or better we do not 
take into reckoning the name of Victor Huga The 
1 gatherings or swollen assemblies of important 
merals who met to dispute the respective claims and 
ts of Shakespeare and Jonson, Milton and Waller, 
[ey and Byron, have on the irfiole fallen duly dumb : 
>ne supreme figure of each time is as generally and 
ily acknowledged by all capable articulate creatures 
^A be desired. To sit in the seat of such disputants 
be no present man's ambition. It ought to be, if it 
ot, superfluous to set down in words the assurance that 
daim for no living poet a place beside the Master ; 
we know there is no lyrist alive but one who could 
sung for us the cradle-song of death, the love-song 
ladness, the sea-song of exile, the hunting-song of 
lution; that since the songs of Gretchen in <title>"Faust"</title>

and Beatrice in the <title>" Cenci,"</title> there have been no such 
songs heard among men as the least of these first four 
among all his lyrics that rise to recollection at the moment 
Fantine's song or Gastibelza's, the <title>" Adieu, patrie ! "</title> or 
the <title>" Chasseur Noir,"</title> any one of these by itself would 
suffice to establish, beyond debate and beyond acclamation, 
the absolute sovereignty of the great poet whose 
gioiy could dispense even with any of these.</p> 

<p>The claims to precedence of other m^n who stand in 
the vanguard of their time are open matters for the discussion 
of judgments to adjust or readjust Among English
speaking poets of his age I know of none who can 
reasonably be said to have given higher proof of the 
highest qualities than Mr. Rossetti ; if the qualities we 
rate highest in poetry be imagination, passion, thought, 
harmony and variety of singing power. Each man who 
has anything has his own circle of work and realm of 
rule, his own field to till and to reign in \ no rival can 
overmatch for firm completion of lyric line, for pathos 
made perfect and careful melody of high or of intimate 
emotion, <title>" New- Year's Eve "</title> or <title>" The Grandmother,"</title> 
<title>" CEnone "</title> or <title>" Boadicea,"</title> the majestic hymn or the rich 
lament for love won and lost in <title>" Maud ; "</title> none can 
emulate the fiery subtlety and sinuous ardour of spirit which 
penetrates and lights up all secret gulfs and glimmering 
heights of human evil and good in <title>" The Ring and the 
Book,"</title> making the work done live because <quote>" the soul of 
man is precious to man : "</quote> none can <quote>" blow in power "</quote> 
again through the notched reed of Pan by the river, to 
detain the sun on the hills with music ; none can outrun

can light as with fires or lull as with flutes of magic the 
reaches of so full a stream of story as flows roimd the 
<title>" Earthly Paradise "</title> with ships of heroes afloat on it 
But for height and range and depth, for diversity and 
perfection of powers, Mr. Rossetti is abreast of elder poets 
not less surely than of yoimger. Again I take to witness, 
four singled poems ; <title>"The Burden of Nineveh,"</title> <title>"Sister 
Helen, "</title> <title>" Jenny,"</title> and <title>" Eden Bower."</title> Though there 
were not others as great as these to cite at need, we might 
be content to pass judgment on the strength of these 
only ; but others as great there are. If he have not the 
full effluence of romance or the keen passion of human 
science that give power on this hand to Morris and on 
that to Browning, his work has form and voice, shapeliness 
and sweetness, imknown to the great analyst ; it has 
' weight and heat, gravity and intensity, wanting to the less 
serious and ardent work of the latest master of romance. 
Neither by any defect of form nor by any default of force 
does he ever fall short of either mark or fight with either 
hand <quote>" as one that beateth the air."</quote> In sureness of 
choice and scope of interest, in solidity of subject and 
sublimity of object, the general worth of his work excels 
the rate of other men's ; he wastes no breath and mistakes 
no distance, sets his genius to no tasks imfit for it, 
and spends his strength in the culture of no fruitless fields. 
What he would do is always what a poet should, and what 
he would do is always done. Bom a light-bearer and 
leader of men, he has always fulfilled his office with 
readiness and done his work with might Help and strength 
and delight and firesh life have long been gifts of his

giviDg, and freely given as only great gifts can be. And now 
that at length we receive from hands yet young and strone 
this treasure of many yeais, the gathered fiowei of yt

themselves what manner of harvest the life of this 1 
was to bear ; all may see that although, in the pei 
phrase of his own sonnet, the last birth of life be de 
as her three first-bom were love and art and song, 
two of these which she has borne to him, art namely 
song, carmot now be made subject to that last ; that life
and love with it may pass away, but very surely no death
that ever may be born shall have power upon these for 
ever.

MORRIS'S LIFE AND DEATH OF JASON. 

The hardest work and the highest that can be done by a 
critic studious of the right is first to discern what is good, 
and then to discover how and in what way it is so. To 
do this office for any man during his life is a task always 
essentially difficult, sometimes seemingly ungracious. We 
demand of the student who stands up as a judge to show us 
as he best may how and why this man excels that, what 
are the stronger and what the weaker sides of his 
attempted or achieved work when set fairly by the work 
of others. For if in some one point at least it does not 
exceed theirs, it is not work of a high kind, and worthy of 
enduring study. Who is to say this, who is to prove it, 
we have first to find out ; and found out it must be, if 
criticism is to be held of more account tlian the ephemeral 
cackle of casual praisers and blamers; if it is to be 
thoughtfiil and truthfiil, worthy the name of an art, handmaid of higher arts. Now, as a rule, men are mistrustful 
of one who takes leave to judge the work of a fellowworkman. And not without reason or show of reason ; 
for no verdicts more foolish or more false have been 
delivered than some of those passed by poet upon poet, 
by painter upon painter. Nor need this be taken as 
proof of anything base or partial or jealous in the 



MORRIS'S LIFE AND DBA TH OF JASON, 1 1 1 

speaker's mind. It is not easy to see at once widely and 
well. For example, could B)Ton and Wordsworth have 
judged better of each other's work, each might have lost 
something of fitness for his own. It is a hard law, but a 
law it is. Against this, however, a counter truth not less 
grave than this must be weighed. We do not appeal to 
men ignorant of politics for a verdict on affairs of state, 
to men unskilled in science on a scientific question. And 
no matter of science or of state is more abstruse and 
hard to settle than a question of art ; nor is any more 
needful to have settled for us in good lime, if only 
lest accident or neglect, ignorance or violence, rob us 
unaware of some precious and irrecoverable thing, not 
known of or esteemed while safely with us. Consider 
what all men have lost already and for ever, merely by 
such base means as these ; how much of classic work and 
mediaeval, how much of Greece, of Italy, of England, has 
gone from us that we might have kept For this and 
other reasons it may be permissible, or pardonable at 
least, for a student of art to speak now and then on art ; 
so long only as he shall speak honestly and carefiilly, 
without overmuch of assmnption or deprecation. 

Over the first fortunes of a newly-born work of art 
accident must usually preside for evil or for good. Over 
the earliest work of the artist whom we are here to take 
note of, that purblind leader of the blind presided on the 
whole for evil. Here and there it met with eager recognition and earnest applause ; nowhere, if I err not, with 
just praise or blame worth heeding. It seems to have 
been now lauded and now decried as the result and expression of a school rather than a man, of a theory or 



112 MORRIS'S LIFE AND 

tradition rather than a poet or student Those who so 
judged were blind guides of the purblind ; reversing thus 
the undivine office of their god Accident Such things 
as were in this book are taught and learnt in no sdiool 
but that of instinct Upon no piece of work in the world 
was the impress of native character ever more distinctly 
stamped, more deeply branded. It needed no exceptional acuteness of ear or eye to see or hear that this poet 
held of none, stole from none, clung to none, as tenant 
or as beggar or as thief. Not as yet a master, he was 
assuredly no longer a pupil. 

A little later than this one appeared another volume 
of poems, not dissimilar in general choice of stories and 
subjects, perfect where this was imperfect, strong where 
this was weak ; but strong and perfect on that side alone. 
All that was wanting here was there supplied; but all that 
; was here supplied was wanting there. In form, in structure, in composition, few poems can be more fauldess 
than those of Mr. Tennyson, few faultier tlian those of 
Mr. Morris, which deal with the legend of Arthur and 
Guenevere. I do not speak here of form in the abstract 
and absolute sense ; for where this is wanting, all is 
wanting ; without this there can be no work of art at alL 
I speak of that secondary excellence always necessary to 
the perfection, but not always indispensable to the existence of art These first poems of Mr. Morris were not 
malformed ; a misshapen poem is no poem ; as well 
might one talk of unnatural nature or superhuman manhood ; but they aie not well clad ; their attire now and 
then has been huddled on ; they have need sometimes 
of combing and trimming. Take that one for example 



DEATH OF JASON, 113 

called " King Arthur's Tomb." It has not been constructed at all \ the parts hardly hold together ; it has 
need of joists and screws, props and rafters. Many able 
writers of verse whom no miracle could endow with competence to do such work would have missed the faults as 
surely as the merits ; would have done something where 
the poet has cared to do nothing. There is scarcely 
connection here, and scarcely composition. There is 
hardly a trace of narrative power or mechanical arrangement There is a perceptible want of tact and practice, 
which leaves the poem in parts indecorous and chaotic. 
But where among other and older poets of his time and 
country is one comparable for perception and expression 
(^tragic truth, of subtle and noble, terrible and piteous 
things ? where a touch of passion at once so broad and 
so sure? The figures here given have the blood and 
breath, the shape and step of life ; they can move and 
sufifer ; their repentance is as real as their desire ; their 
shame lies as deep as their love. They are at once 
remorseful for the sin and regretful of the pleasure that is 
past The retrospective vision of Launcelot and of 
Guenevere is as passionate and profoimd as life. Riding 
towards her without hope, in the darkness and the heat of 
the way, he can but divert and sustain his spirit by recollection of her loveliness and her love, seen long since asleep 
and waking, in another place than this, on a distant 
night 

•• Pale in the green sky were the stars, I ween, 
Because the moon shone like a tear she shed 
When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago 
And ruled all things but God.'' 

I 



114 MORRIS'S LIFE AND 

Retrospect and vision, natural memories and spiritual, 
here coalesce ; and how exquisite is the retrospect, and 
how passionate the vision, of past light and colour in the 
( sky, past emotion and conception in the soul ! Not in 
the idyllic school is a chord ever struck, a note ever 
sounded, so tender and subtle as this. Again, when 
Guenevere has maddened herself and him with wfld 
words of reproach and remorse, abhorrence and attraction, her sharp and sudden memory of old sights and 
sounds and splendid irrevocable days finds word and 
form not less noble and faithful to &ct and life. The 
first words of Arthur bidding her cherish the knight 
" whom all the land called his banner, sword, and shield; " 
the long first pressure of Launcelot's Ups on her hand ; the 
passionate and piteous course of love here ended (if ended 
at all) above the king's grave dug in part and unwittingly 
by their wrong-doing ; the solitary sound of birds singing 
in her gardens, while in the lists the noise went on of 
spears and shouts telling which knight of them all rode 
here or there ; the crying of ladies' names as men and 
horses clashed one against another, names that bit like 
the steel they impelled to its mark ; the agony of anger 
and horror which gives edge and venom to h^ 

memory — 

•* Banner of Arthur — with black-bended shield 

** Sinister- wise across the fair gold ground ! 

Here let me tell you what a knight you are, 
O sword and shield of Arthur 1 you are found 
A crooked sword, I think, that leaves a scar

Twisted Malay's crease, beautiful blue-grey. 
Poisoned with sweet fruit — as he found too late,

** O sickle cutting harvest all day long, 

That the husbandman across his shoulder hangs, 
And going homeward about evensong. 
Dies the next morning, struck through by the fangs ] " * 

— all these points and phases of passion are alike truly 
and nobly rendered. I have not read the poem for 
years, I have not the book at hand, and I dte from 
memory ; but I think it would be safe to swear to the 
accuracy of my citation. Such verses are not forgetable. 
They are not, indeed, — as are the " Idylls of the King" 
— ^the work of a dexterous craftsman in full practice. ,' , 
Little beyond dexterity, a rare eloquence, and a laborious \ \ 
patience of hand, has been given to the one or denied to' 
the other.* These are good gifts and great; but it i^ 
better to want clothes than limbs. ^ 

The shortcomings of this first book are nowhere ■ 
traceable in the second now lying before us. A nine 

* Perhaps in all this noble passage of poetry there is nothing 
nobler than this bitter impulse of irony, this fiery shame and rage 
of repentance, which here impels Guenevere to humiliate herself 
through her lover, and thus consummate the agony of abasement. 
"False and fatal as banner, or shield, or sword, wherein is he better 
than a peasant's dangerous and vulgar implement, as fatal to him 
it may be, by carelessness or chance, as a king's weapon to tht 
king if handled amiss ? " And yet for all this she cannot but cleave 
to him ; through her lover she scourges herself; it is suicide in her 
to slay him ; but even so his soul must needs be saved — ** so as by 
fire. " No poet about to start on his course ever saw for himself or 
showed to others a thing more tragic and more true than this study 
of noble female passion, half selfless and half personal, half mad 
ai^ half sane. 

* The comparison here made is rather between book and book 
than between man and man. Both poets have done better elsewhere, each after his kind ; and except by his best work no workman can be fairly judged. A critic who should underrate either 

would be condemnable on both hands. 

I 2 



ii6 MOHmS'S LIFE AND 

years' space does not lie between them in vain ; enough 
has been learned and unlearned, rejected and attained. 
Here indeed there is not the stormy variety, the lyric 
ardour of the first book ; there is not the passion of the 
ballads, the change of note and diversity of power, all 
that fills with life and invigorates with colour the artist* s 
earlier designs ; for not all of this is here needed. Of 
passion and humour, of impulse and instinct, he had 
given noble and sufficient proof in manifold ways. But 
this '^ Jason " is a large and coherent poem, completed as 
conceived ; the style throughout on a level with the invention. In direct narrative power, in clear forthright 
manner of procedure, not seemingly troubled to select, to 
pick and sift and winnow, yet never superfluous or 
verbose, never straggling or jarring ; in these high 
qualities it resembles the work of Chaucer. Even against 
the great master his pupil may fairly be matched for 
• simple sense of right, for grace and speed of step, for 
^ purity and justice of colour. In all the noble roll of our 
poets there has been since Chaucer no second teller of 
tales, no second rhapsode comparable to the first, till the 
advent of this one. As with the Greeks, so with us ; we 
have had in lieu of these a lyric and a tragic school ; we 
have also had the subordinate schools, gnomic and 
idyllic, domestic and didactic But the old story-singers, 
the old "Saga-men," we have no more heard of. As 
soon might we have looked for a ^esh Odyssey fix)m 
southward, a fresh Njala fi-om northward. And yet no 
higher school has brought forth rarer poets than this. 
" But," it is said, " this sort of poetry is a March flower, 
a child of the first winds and sims of a nation ; in May 



DEATH OF JASON, 117 

even, much more in August, you cannot have it except by 
forcing ; and forcing it will not bear. A late romance is 
a hothouse daffodil" And so indeed it must usually be. 
But so it is not here ; and the proof is the poem. It could 
not be done, no doubt, only it has been. Here is a 
poem sown of itself^ sprung from no alien seed, cast after 
no alien model \ fresh as wind, bright as light, frill of the 
spring and the sun. It shares of course the conditions 
c^its kind ; it has no time for the subtleties and hardly 
room for the ardours of tragic poetry. Passion in romance is of its nature subordinate to action ; the flowing 
stream of story hushes and lulls the noise of its gurgling 
and refluent eddies with a still predominance of sound. 
To me it seems that there has here been almost too 
much of this. Only by rare and brief jets does the poet 
let out the fire of a potent passion which not many others 
can kindle and direct For the most part, the river of 
romance flows on at frill, but keeping well to its channel, 
unvexed t^ rains and undisturbed by whirlpools. In a 
word, through great part of this poem there is no higher 
excellence attempted than that of adventurous or romantic narrative couched in the simplest and fittest 
forms of poetry. This abstinence is certainly not due to 
impotence, possibly not to intention, more probably to 
distaste. Mr. Morris has an English respect for tempenmce and reserve ; good things as drags, but not as 
dogs. He is not afiraid to tackle a passion, but he will 
not move an inch frx)m hi^ way to tackle it Tragedy 
can never be more than the episode of a romance, and 
romance is rather to his taste than naked tragedy. He 
reminds us of the knight in Chaucer cutting sharply short

es of the excellences we have noted — the 
LIT and noble justice of composition, the 
ifiil touches of landscape incident — almost 
poem might be turned up. Compare the

nt where Jason "died stningely." No

DEATH OF JASON. 119 

flower of the landscape is slurred, but no flower is obtrusive ; the painting is broad and minute at once, large and 
sure by dint of accuracy. And there are wonderful 
touches on it of fairy mystery ; weird lights pass over it 
and wafts of mjrstical wind ; as here : — 

" There comes a murmur from the shore, 
And in the place two fair streams are, 
Drawn from the purple hilb afar, 
Drawn doym unto the restless sea. 
The hills whose flowers nierfed the bee. 
The shore no ship has ever seen, 
StiU beaten by the billows gieen, 
Whose murmur comes unceasingly 
Unto the place for which I cry.*' 

All this song of a nymph to Hylas is full of the melody 
which involves colour and odour, but the two lines marked 
have in them the marvel and the music of a dream. Nor 
is any passage in the poem pitched in a higher and clearer 
key than the first hymn of Orpheus as Argo takes the 
sea. As noble is the song of triiunph at p. 217, which 
should be set by the side of this, to which it is in some 
sort antiphonaL 

But the root of the romance lies of course in the character of Medea ; and here, where it was needfullest to do 
well, the poet has done best At her first entrance the 
poem takes new life and rises out of the atmosphere of 
mere adventure and incident. The subdued and delicate 
ardour of the scene in Jason's chamber, following as it 
does on the ghasdy beauty of that in the wood of the 
Three-formed, is proof enough and at once with how 
strong and soft a touch the picture will be completed. 
Her incantations, and her flight with Jason, have no less 



i 



I20 MORRIS'S LIFE AND 

of fanciful and tender power. The fifteenth book, where 
she beguiles Pelias to death at the hands of his daughters, 
is a sample of flawless verse and noble imagination unsurpassed by any here. For dramatic invention and 
vivid realism of the impossible, which turns to £ur and 
sensible truth the wildest dreams of legend, there has 
been no poet for centuries comparable. But the very 
flower and crest of this noble poem is the final tragedy at 
Corinth. Queen, sorceress, saviour, she has sunk or 
risen to mere woman ; and not in vain before entering 
the tragic lists has the poet called on that great poet's 
memory who has dealt with the terrible and pitifiil passion 
of women like few but Shakespeare since. 

Worthy, indeed, even of the master-hand is all that 
follows. Let the student weigh well the slight but great 
touches in which the fitful fury and pity and regret of the 
sufierer are given ; so delicate and accurate that only by 
the entire and majestic harmony of tragedy will he discern 
the excellence and justice of every component note. To 
come upon this part of the poem is as the change from 
river to sea (Book XII.), when wind and water had a 
laiger savour in lip and nostril of the Argonauts. Note 
well the new and piteous beauty of this : — 

** Kindly I deal with thee, mine enemy ; 
Since swift forgetfulness to thee I send. 
But thou shalt die — his eyes shall see thine end — 
Ah ! if thy death alone could end it all ! 

" But ye — skail I behold you when leeofesjdll^ 
In some sad evening of the autumu'tide? 
Or shall I have you sitting by my side 
Amidst the feast, so that folk stare and say, 
* Sure the grey wolf has seen the queen to-day ' ? 



DEATH OF JASON. 

What I when I kneel in temples of the Gods 
Miut I bethink me of the upturned sods. 
And hear s Toice say : ' Mother, wilt thou come 
And see ns resting in our new-made home, 
Since thou wert used to make us lie full soft. 
Smoothing our pillows many a time and oft ? 
O mother, now no dainty food we need. 
Whereof of old thou usedst to hare such heed. 
O mother, now we need no gown of gold. 
Nor in the winter time do we grow cold ; 
Thy hands would bathe us when we were thine own. 
Now doth the rain wash every shiiung bone- 
No pedagogoe we need, for sorely heaven 
lies spi^ abote us, with the fjanets seven. 
To leach us all its lore.' " 

Sarely but in the ballad and romance periods 
sacb poetry been written, so broad and sad and sin 
so fall of deep and direct fire, certain of its aim, wit! 
finish, without &tilt. The passion from hence fills 
burns to a.dose ; the verse for a little is as the gam 
of Medea steeped in strange moisture as of tears 
liquid flame to be kindled by the sim. 

" O sous, with what sweet counsels and what tean 
Wonld I have hearkened to the hopes and fears 
Of yoai Srat loves : what raptnre had it been 
Your dear letotning footsteps to have seen 
Amidst the happy warriors of the land ; 
But naif— but ttvui—lhii is a liuU hand. 
Too ofiat JUtiai time love did first iegin

It should now be clear, or never, that in this poe 
Dew thing of great price has been cast into the En] 
treasure-house. Nor is the cutting <» the setting of

jewel unworthy of it; art and instinct have wrought 
hand in hand to its perfection. Other and various fields 
await the workman who has here approved himself a 
master, acceptable into the guild of great poets on a 
footing of his own to be shared or disputed by no 
other. Strained clear and guided straight as now, his 
lofty lyrical power must keep all its promise to us. Diffusion is in the nature of a romance, and it cannot be 
said that here the stream has ever overflowed into marshland or stagnated in lock or pool Therefore we do not 
blame the length and fullness of so fair a river ; but something of barrier or dam may serve to concentrate and condense the next Also, if we must note the slightest ripples 
of the water-flies that wrinkle it, let us set down in 
passing that there are certain slight laxities or perversities 
of metre which fret the ear and perplex the eye, noticeable 
only as the least shortcoming is noticeable in great work. 
Elision, for example, is a necessity, not a luxuty, of metre. 
This law Chaucer, a most loyal versifier, never allows 
himself to slight after the fashion of his follower. But 
into these straits of technical art we need not now steer. 
So much remains unremarked, so much unsaid ; so much 
of beauty slighted, of uncommended excellence ; that I 
close these inadequate and hurried notes with a sense of 
grave injustice done. To the third book of Mr. Morris 
we look now, not for the seal of our present judgment, 
but for the accomplishment of our highest hopes ; for a 
fresh honour done to English ait, a fresh delight to us, 
and a fresh memory for the future.

MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS, 

(1867.) 

There are two things which most men begin by hating 
until they have won their way, and which when combined 
are more than doubly hateful to all in whose eyes they 
are not doubly admirable : perfection of *work, and 
personality in the workman. As to perfection, it must be 
seen to be loved, and few have eyes to see it To none 
but these few can it be acceptable at first ; and only because 
these few are the final legislators of opinion, the tacit and 
patient lawgivers of time, does it ever win acceptance. 
A strong personal tone of character stamped and ingrained into a man's work, if more offensive at first to the 
mass, is likelier to find favour before long in the sight of 
some small body or sect of students. If not repulsive, it 
must be attractive and impressive ; and there are always 
mental cripples in plenty to catch at a strong man's staff 
and cut it down into a crutch for themselves. But the 
more love a man has for perfection, the more faith in 
form, the more instinct for art, the fewer will these early 
believers be, and the better worth having ; the process of 
winning their suffrages will be slower, and surer the hold 
of them when won. 

For some years the immediate fame of Mr. Matthew 
Arnold has been almost exclusively the fame of a prose 



124 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

writer. Those students could hardly find hearing — ^they 
have nowhere of late found expression that I know of — 
who, with all esteem and enjoyment of his essays, of their 
clearness, candour, beauty of sentiment and style, retained 
the opinion that if justly judged he must be judged by his 
verse and not by his prose ; certainly not by this alone ; 
that future students would cleave to that with more of 
care and of love j that the most memorable quality about 
him was the quality of a poet Not that they liked the 
prose less, but that they liked the verse more. His best 
essays ought to live longer than most, his best poems cannot but \\\t as long as any, of their time. So it seemed 
to some who were accordingly more eager to receive and 
more careful to study a new book of his poems than most 
books they could have looked for ; and since criticism of 
the rapid and limited kind possible to contemporaries can 
be no more than the sincere exposition of the writer's 
belief and of his reasons for it, I, as one of these, desire, 
with all deference but with all decision, to say what I 
think of this book, and why. For the honour of criticism, 
if it is to win or to retain honour at all, it must be well 
for the critic to explain clearly his personal point of view, 
instead of fighting behind the broad and crestless shield 
of a nameless friend or foe. The obscurest name and 
blazon are at least recognisable; but a mere voice is 
mere wind, though it affect to speak with the tongues 
and the authority of men and of angels. 

First on this new stage is the figure of an old fiiend 
and teacher. Mr. Arnold says that the poem of " Empedocles on Etna " was withdrawn before fifty copies of the 
first edition were sold. I must suppose then that one

of these was the copy I had when a schoolboy — how 
snatched betimes from the wreck and washed across my 
way I know not ; but I remember well enough how then 
as now the songs of Callicles clove to my ear and memory. 
Early as this was, it was not my first knowledge of the 
poet ; the " Reveller," the " Merman," the " New Sirens," 
I had mainly by heart in a time of childhood just ignorant of 
teens. I do not say I understood the latter poem in a literal 
or logical ^hion, but I had enjoyment enough of its 
music and colour and bright sadness as of a rainy sunset 
or sundawn. A thild with any ear or eye for the attraction 
of verse or art can dispense with analysis and rest content 
to apprehend it without comprehension; it were to be 
wished that adults equally incapable would rest equally 
content Here I must ask, as between brackets, if this 
beautiful poem is never to be reissued after the example 
of its younger ? ^ No poet could afford to drop or destroy 
it ; I might at need call into court older and better judges 
to back my judgment in this ; meantime '^ I hope here 
be proofe " that, however inadequate may be my estimate 
of the poet on whom I am now to discourse, it is not inadequate through want of intimacy with his work. At 
the risk of egotism, I record it in sign of gratitude ; I cannot count the hours of pure and high pleasure, I cannot 
reckon the help and guidance in thought and work, which 
I owe to him as to all other real and noble artists whose 
mfluence it was my fortime to feel when most susceptible 
of infiuence, and least conscious of it, and most in want

our school as upon one wholly void of spiritual or imagina> 
tive culture, he speaks of his poems as known to no laige 
circle — implies this at least, if I remember : he will not 
care to be assured that to some boys at Eton Sohrab and 
Rustum, Tristram and Iseult, have been close and common 
friends, their stream of Oxus and bays of Brittany familiar 
almost as the well-loved Thames weirs and reaches. However, of this poem of " Empedocles " the world it seems 
was imtimely robbed, though I remember on searching 
to have found a notice of it here and there. Certain 
fragments were then given back by way of dole, chiefly in 
the second series of the author's revised poems. But 
one, the largest if not the brightest jewel, was withheld ; 
the one long and lofty chant of Empedocles. The reasons 
assigned by Mr. Arnold in a former preface for cancelling 
the complete poem had some weight : the subject-matter 
is oppressive, the scheme naked and monotonous; the 
blank verse is not sonorous, not vital and various enough ; 
in spite of some noble interludes, it fails on the whole to 
do the work and cany the weight wanted ; its simplicity 
is stony and grey, with dry flats and rough whinstones. 
To the lyrics which serve as water-springs and pastures 
I shall have to pay tribute of thanks in their turn; 
but first I would say something of that strain of choral 
philosophy which falls here '* as the shadow of a great 
rock in a weary land." It is a model of grave, clear, 
I solemn verse; the style plain and bare, but sufficient and 
strong ; the thought deep, lucid, direct We may say of 
it what the author has himself said of the wise and sublime 
verses of Epictetus, that " the fortitude of that is for the 
strong, for the few; even for them, the spiritual atmo- 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 127 

sphere with which it surrounds them is bleak and grey ; " 
but the air is higher and purer, the ground firmer, the 
view clearer; we have a surer foothold on these cold 
hills of thought than in the moist fragrance of warmer 
air which steeps the meadows and marshes of sentiment 
and tradition. 

*' Thin, thin the pleasant human noises grow, 

And &int the city gleams ; 
Rare the lone pastoral huts ; marvel not thou ! 
The solemn peaks but to the stars are known, 
But to the stars, and the cold lunar beams ; 
Alone the sun arises, and alone 

Spring the great streams." 

These noble verses of another poem clipped from 
Mr. Arnold's first book, and left hanging in firagments 
about one's memory — I here make my protest against its 
excision ^ — ^may serve as types of the later, the more immediate and elaborate discourse of thought here embodied 
and attired in words of stately and simple harmony. It 
is no small or common comfort, after all the delicate and 
ingenious shuffling of other English poets about the edge 
of deep things, to come upon one who speaks with so 
large and clear and calm an utterance; who begins at 
the taproot and wellspring of the matter, leaving others 
to wade ankle-deep in still waters and weave river-flags 
or lake-lilies in lieu of stemming the stream. Nothing 
in verse or out of verse is more wearisome than the delivery of reluctant doubt, of half-hearted hope and half-

incredulous £dtlL A man who suffers from the strong 
desire either to believe or disbelieve something he cannot 
may be worthy of sympathy, is certainly worthy of pity, 
imtilhe b^;ins to speak; and if he tries to speak in verse, 
he misuses the implement of an artist We have had 
evidences of religion, aspirations and suspirations of all 
kinds, melodious regrets and tortuous returns in &vour 
or disfavour of this creed or that — all by way of poetic 
work; and all within the compass and shot-range of a 
single faith ; all, at the widest, bounded north, south, east, 
and west by material rivers or hills, by an age or two 
since, by a tradition or two ; all leaving the spirit cramped 
and thirsty. We have had Christian sceptics, handcuffed 
fighters, tongue-tied orators, plume-plucked eagles; believers whose belief was a sentiment, and free-thinkers 
who saw nothing before Christ or beyond Judaa. To 
get at the bare rock is a relief after acres of such quaking 
groimd. 

A French critic has expressed this in words which I 
may quote here, torn out from their context : — ^^ Le c6t^ 
fort du caract^re d'un peuple fait souvent le cot^ faible de 
sa po&ie. Ces poetes anglais p^chent du c6t^ de la

effectivement ou trop religieux ou trop raisonnables. 
C'est qu*ils ont la manie de vouloir r^concilier les choses 
irr^conciliables. On voit cela partout, dans la politique, 
dans les beaux arts, dans la vie pratique, dans la vie iddale.

one could have answered him, and at any length. Envy doubtless 
as well as error must have inspired this blasphemy against the Constitution once delivered to the saints — that august result of a plenary 
inflation above the reach of human wisdom, sent down direct from 
heaven, and vouchsafed alone to this chosen nation, this peculiar 
people ; to which, as to Tyre or Jerusalem in time past, the Supreme 
Powers have said by the sweet voices of their representative elect — 
elect of gods and men — '* Thou sealest up the sum ; full of wisdom,

ffippancy and violence of manner, I am disposed in 
part to agree with this critic 

Elsewhere, in minor poems, Mr. Arnold also has now 
and then given signs of an inclination for that sad task ot 
sweeping up dead leaves fallen from the dying tree ot 
bdief ; but has not wasted much time or strength on such 
sterile and stupid work. Here, at all events, he has 
wasted none; here is no melodious whine of retrospective 
and r^retfiil scepticism; here are no cobwebs of plea 
and counterplea, no jungles of argument and brakes of 
analysis. " Ask what most helps when known \ '' let be 
the oracular and the miraculous, and vex not the soul 
about their truth or falsehood; the soul, which oracles 
and miracles can neither make nor mar, can neither slay 
nor save. 

** Once read thy own breast right. 
And thou hast done with fears. 
Man gets no other light. 
Search he a thousand years. 
Sink in thyself; there ask what ails thee, at that shrine.*'

that of intellectual self-rdiance, self-dependence, selfrespect; an evangel not to be cancelled or supplanted 
by any revelation of mystic or prophet or saint Out of 
this counsel grows the exposition of obscure and afflictive 
things. Man's welfare — ^his highest sphere and state of 
spiritual well-doing and well-being — ^this indeed is his true 
aim ; but not this is the aim of nature : the world has 
other work than this to do ; and we, not it, must submit : 
submit, not by ceasing to attempt and achieve the best 
we can, but by ceasing to expect subservience to our own 
ends from all forces and influences of existing things ; it is 
no reason or excuse for living basely instead of nobly, that 
we must live as the sons and not as the lords of nature. 
" To tunes we did not call oiu: being must keep chime ; " 
but this bare truth we will not accept Philosophy, as 
forcibly and clearly as religion, indicates the impediments 
of sin and self-will ; " we do not what we "bught, what we 
ought not we do;" but there religion stops, as far as 
regards this world, and passes upward into a new woiid 
and life; philosophy has further to go without leaving 
her hold upon earth. Even were man pure, just, wise, 
instead of imwise, unjust, and impiu'e, this would not 
affect the " other existences that dash with ours." 

is a compound of too barbaric sotind, and "self-suiBciency" has 
fallen into a term of reproach. Archbishop Trench has pointed out 
how and why a word which to the ancient Greek signified a noble 
virtue came to signify to the modem Christian the base vice of presumption. I do not see that human language has gained by this 
change of meaning, or that the later mood of mind which dictated 
this debasement of the word is at all in advance of the older, or 
indicative of any spiritual improvement ; rather the alteration seems 
to me a loss and a discredit, and the tone of thought which made the 
quality venerable more sound and wise than that which declares it 
vile. 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 135 

** Like us, the lightning fires 

Love to haye scope and play ; 
The stream, like us, desires 
An unimpeded way ; 
like us, the Libyan wind delights to roam at large. 

'* Streams will not curb their pride 
The just man not to entomb, 
Nor lightnings go aside 
To leave his virtues room ; 
Nor is that wind less rough which blows a good man's barge. 

■ 

" Nature, with equal mind, 
Sees all her sons at play ; 
Sees man control the wind. 
The wind sweep man away : 
Allows the proudly-riding and the founder'd bark." 

Again, there are "the ill- deeds of other men" to fill 
up the account against us of painful and perilous things. 
And we, instead of doing and bearing all we can under 
our conditions of life, must needs " cheat our pains " like 
children after a fell who " rate the senseless ground : " 

*' So, loth to suffer mute, 

We, peopling the void air, 
Make gods to whom to impute 
The iUs we ought to bear ; 
With God and Fate to rail at, suffering easily. 

" Yet grant — as sense long miss'd 
Things that are now perceiv'd, 
And much may still exist 
Which is not yet believ'd — 
Grant that the world were full of Gods we cannot see ; 

« All thiiigs the world which fiQ 
Of but one stuff are spun, 
That we who rail are still, 
With what we jail at, one ; 
One with the o'er-labour'd Power that through the breadth and

sponse fifom natural things unseen, or from the lips of 
their own wisest, confronts their fancies as before. 

<* Fools ! that so often here 

Happiness mocked our prayer, 
I think, might make us fear 
A like event elsewhere ; 
Make us, not fly to dreams, but moderate desire." 

Nor finally, when all is said, need the wise despair or repine because debarred from dreams of a distant and 
dubious happiness in a world outside of ours. 

" Is it so small a thing 

To have enjoyed the sun. 
To have lived light in the spring, 
To have loved, to have thought, to have done ? '' 

The poorest villager feels that it is not so small a 
thing that he should not be loth to lose the little that life 
can yield him. Let the wiser man, like him, trust without fear the joys that are; life has room for effort and 
enjoyment, though at sight of the evil and soirow it 
includes one may have abjured &lse faith and foolish 
hope and fruidess fear. 

The majesty and composure of thought and verse, 
die perfect clearness and competence of words, distinguish 
this from other poetry of the intellect now more approved 
and applauded. The matter or aigument is not less deep 
and close than dear and even in expression ; although 
diis lucidity and equality of style may diminish its material > 
value in eyes used to the fog and ears trained to the 
datter of the chaotic school But a poem throughout so 
flowerless and pallid would miss much of the common 
charm of poetry, however imbued with the serene and

severe splendour of snows and stars. And the special 
crown and praise of this one is its fine and gentle alternation of tone and colour. All around the central peak, 
bathed in airs high as heaven and cloven with craters 
deep as hell, the tender slopes of hill and pasture close 
up and climb in gradual grace of undulation, full of sunbeams and murmiu^y winds and birds. The lyric interludes 
of the " Empedodes " are doubdess known by heart to 
many ignorant of their original setting, in which they are 
now again enchased. We have no poet comparable for 
power and perfection of landscape. This quality was 
never made more of by critics, sought after by poets 
with so much care ; and our literature lies in full flowerage of landscape, like Egjrpt after the reflux of the Nile. 
We have galleries ftiU of beautiful and ingenious studies, 
and an imperial academy of descriptive poets. The 
supreme charm of Mr. Arnold's work is a sense of right 
resulting in a spontaneous temperance which bears no 
mark of curb or snaffle, but obeys the hand with imperceptible submission and gracious reserve. Other and 
older poets are to the full as vivid, as incisive and impressive; others have a more pungent colour, a more 
trenchant outline; others as deep knowledge and as 
fervid enjoyment of natural things. But no one has in 
like measure that tender and final quality of touch which 
tempers the excessive light and suffuses the refluent 
shade ; which as it were washes with soft air the sides of 
the earth, steeps with dew of quiet and dyes with colours 
of repose the ambient ardour of noon, the fiery affluence 
of evening. His verse bathes us with fresh radiance and 
light rain, when weary of the violence of summer and

winter in which others dazzle and detain us j his spring 
wears here and there a golden waif of autumn, his autumn 
a rosy stray of spring. His tones and effects are pure, 
lucid, aerial ; he knows by some fine impulse of temper- * 
ance all rules of distance, of reference, of proportion ; 
nothing is thrust or pressed upon our eyes, driven or 
beaten into our ears. For the instinctive selection of ^ , 
simple and effectual detail he is immatched among / 
&iglish poets of the time, unless by Mr. Morris, whose 1/ 
landscape has much of the same quality, as clear, as ;» 
noble, and as memorable — memorable for this especially, 
that you are not vexed or fretted by mere brilliance of 
point and sharpness of stroke, and such intemperate 
excellence as gives astonishment the precedence of 
admiration : such beauties as strike you and startle and 
go out Of these it is superfluous to cite instances from 
the ablest of our countrymen's works ; they are taught 
and teach that the most remote, the most elaborate, the 
most intricate and ingenious fashions of allusion and detail 
make up the best poetical style ; they fill their verse with 
sharp-edged prettinesses, with shining surprises and 
striking accidents that are anything but casual ; upon 
every limb and feature you see marks of the chisel and 
the plane : there is a conscious complacency of polish 
which seems to rebuke emulation and challenge improvement It is otherwise with the two we have named; 
they are not pruned and pared into excellence, they have 
not so much of pungency and point; but they have breadth 
and ease and purity, they have largeness and sureness of 
eyesight ; they know what to give and to withhold, 
what to express and to suppress. Above all, they have

air ; you can breathe and move in their landscape, nor 
\ \ are you tripped up and caught at in passing by intrusive 
\ 1 and singular and exceptional beauties which break up and 
' ^ distract the simple charm of general and single beauty, 
the large and musical unity of things. Their best verse is 
not brought straight or worked right ; it falls straight 
because it cannot fall awry ; it comes right because it 
cannot go wrong. And this wide and delicate sense of 
right makes the impression of their work so durable. 
The effect is never rubbed off or worn out; the hot 
suffering eastern life of " The Sick King in Bokhara ; " 
the basking pastures and blowing pines about the 
'' Chiurch of Brou ; " the morning field and midday moorland so fondly and fully and briefly painted in '' Resignation ; " above all, to me at least, the simple and perfect 
sea-side in the " Merman " — " the sandy down where the 
sea-stocks bloom," the white-walled town with narrow 
paved streets, the Httle grey church with rain- worn stones 
and smaU leaded panes, and blown about all the breath 
of wind and sound of waves — these come in and remain 
with us ; these give to each poem the form and colour 
and attire it wants, and make it a distinct and complete 
achievement The description does not adorn or decorate 
the thought ; it is part of it ; they have so grown into 
each other that they seem not welded together, but indivisible and twin-bom. 

Of the five songs of Callicles — whom we have left 
somewhat too long midway on Etna — ^that of Marsyas 
seems to me the highest and sweetest in tone, unless the 
first place be rather claimed for that of Cadmus and 
Harmonia. Others may prefer the first for its exquisite 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 141 

grace of scenery, or the last for its fresh breath and light, 
shed on softer places than the fiery cone of Etna — for its 
sweetness and calm, subduing, after all, the force of flames 
and darkness with the serenity of stars and song ; but 
how fine in each one alike is the touch which relieves the 
scenery with personal life, Chiron's or Typho's or the 
. sleeping shepherds' and passing Muses'. We have no 
word but the coarse and insufficient word taste to express 
that noble sense of harmony and high poetic propriety 
shown in the arrangement and composition of these 
lyrics ; the first, ftill of the bright moist breath of wellwatered glen and well-wooded ford, serving as prelude 
with its clear soft notes to the high monotone of £mpedodes; the second, when that has ceased upon the 
still keen air, rising with fiiUer sweetness from below. 
Nothing can be more deep and exquisite in poetical tact 
than this succession of harmonies, diverse without a 
discord. For the absolute loveliness of sound and 
colour in this and the next song there are no adequate 
words that would not seem violent ; and violence is too 
for firom tins poetry to invade even the outlying province 
of commentary. It must be accepted as the *' warm bay 
among the green lUyrian hills " accepts the sunlight, as 
the frame of maiden flowers and enclosure of gentle grass 
accept the quiet presence of the sacred snakes. No ear 
can forget the cadence, no eye the colour ; I am half 
shaken in my old preference of the next ode imtil I recall 
it from end to end : 

** That triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre, 
That famous, final victory, 
When jealous Pan with Marsyas did conspire ; 



142 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS, 

When, from &r Parnassus' side. 
Young Apollo, all the pride 
Of the Phrygian flutes to tame, 
To the Phrygian highlands came." 

Verse stately as the step and radiant as the head of 
Apollo ; not " like to the night ** this time, but coming as 
the morning to the hills. How clear it makes the distance 
between Parnassus and Phrygia, the beautiful scorn and 
severe youth of the God, leaving for these long reed-beds 
and rippled lakes and pine-clad ridges of hill the bays 
and olives of his Greece ; how clear the presence of the 
hstening Muses, the advent of the hunying Maenads, the 
weeping Olympus, and the implacable repose of Apollo. 
No poet has ever come so near the perfect Greek ; he 
has strung with a fresh chord the old Sophoclean lyre ; 
he has brought back the Muses from Phrygia even to 
Colonus ; 

xAitfpMs {nth fidoauis' 

he has watered afresh the fruitful foliage of that imfooted 
grove of the God, sunless and stormless in all seasons of 
wind or sun ; and for him the sleepless wellsprings of 
Cephisus are yet imminished and unfrozen, 

Even after his master, the disciple of Sophocles holds his 
high place; he has matched against the Attic of the 
Gods this Hyperborean dialect of oiu^, and has not 
earned the doom of Marsyas. Here is indeed the triumph 



■ 1 . J ^^^^^^^^K^mm 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 143 

of the lyre ; and he has had to refashion it for himself 
among a nation and in an age of flute-players and hornblowers. 

For the rest, the scheme of this poem is somewhat 
meagre and inefficient Dramatic or not, the figure of 
Empedocles as here conceived is noble, full of a high and 
serene interest ; but the figinre as here represented is a 
g^ost, without form and void ; and darkness is upon the 
&ce of the deep in which his life lies stagnant \ and we 
look in vain for the spirit to move upon the face of the 
waters. Dimly and with something of discomfort and 
depression we perceive the shadow of the poet's design ; 
we discern in rough and thin outline the likeness of the 
wise world-wearied man, worn down and worsted in the 
struggle of spirit against unwisdom and change and 
adverse force of men and things. But how he stands 
thus apart among the saints and sophists, whence and 
whither he comes and goes, what ruin lies behind or what 
revolution before, we hardly see at all. Not only do we 
contemplate a disembodied spirit, but a spirit of which we 
cannot determine how it was once embodied, what forms 
of thought or sense it once put on, what labour and what 
life it once went through. There is a poetry of the 
bodiless intellect, which without touching with finger-tip 
or wing-tip the edge of actual things may be wise and 
sweet and fruitful and sublime ; but at least we must see 
the light and feel the air which guides forward and buoys 
upward the naked fleshless feet of the spirit Grant that 
we want no details of bodily life and terrene circumstance, no touch of local or temporal colour ; we want at 
least an indication of the spiritual circumstance, the

spiritual influence, widiout which this poetiy would have 
no matter to work upon. *' II ^llait nous &ire sentir 
Fentourage, ITiabillement, le milieu respirable de cette 
&me nuageuse, de cet esprit fatigud.'' After the full 
efiiision of spirit in his one great utterance, Empedocles 
has little to bring forth but fiiagments and relics of the 
soul, shadows of thin suggestion and floating complaint 
The manliness and depth, the clearness and sufficiency of 
thought have passed from him; he is vague andweak,^ 
dissatisfied much as the commonest thinker is dissatisfied 
with whom all things have not gone well, to whom all 
things are visibly imperfect and sensibly obscure. Now 
the prophet of nature who spoke to us and to Pausanias in 
the solemn modulation of his lyric speech was more than 
that There needs no ghost come fix)m the grave — Acre 
needs no philosopher scale the summit of Etna — to tell 
us &is that we find here : that a man had better die than 
live who can neidier live with other men as they do nor 
wholly suffice to himself \ that power and cunning and 
folly are fellows, that they are lords of life in ages of 
men with minds vulgar and feeble, and overcome the 
great and simple servants of justice and the right ; that 
the lord of our spirit and our song, the god of all singers 
and all seers, is an intolerable and severe god, dividing and 
secluding his elect firom full enjoyment of what others 
enjoy, in the stress and severity of solitude^ — sacrificing 
the weaker and sequestering the strong ; that men on 
whom all these things beat and bear more heavily than 
they need can find no fullness of comfort or commimion 
in the eternal elements made of like matter with us, but 
better made, nor in any beauty nor m any life of the

laborious and sleepless soul of things ; that even when all 
other components of our transient nature are duly and 
happily resolved into those durable elements, the insoluble 
and inevitable riddle of mind and thought must vex us to 
the last as at the first 

" We know all this, we know ! 
Cam*st thou from heaven, O child 
Of light ! but this to declare ? 
Alas ! to help us forget 
Such barren knowledge awhile, 
God gave the poet his song." 

Not that such barren knowledge is ignoble or inadequate matter for poetry ; only it must assume something 
of the dramatic form and circiunstance which here are 
scantily supplied. Less scanty is the supply of noble 
verses such as these : 

" But we received the shock of mighty thoughts 
On simple minds with a pure natural joy ; '' 

verses in the highest tone of Wordsworth's, as clear and 1 
grave as his best, as close and full and majestic. The \ 
good and evil influence of that great poet, perverse ■ 
theorist, and incomplete man, upon Mr. Arnold's work 
is so palpable and so strong as to be almost obtrusive in 
its effects. He is the last worth reckoning whom the 
" Excursion " is ever likely to misguide. The incalculable 
power of Wordsworth on certain minds for a certain time 
could not but be and could not but pass over. Part of 
this singular power was doubtless owing to the might of 
^iU, the solid individual weight of mind, which moulded 
his work into the form he chose for it ; part to the strong 
assumption and high self-reliance which grew in him so 
close to self-confidence and presimiption ; part to the 

L 



146 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

sublimity and supremacy of his genius in its own climate 
and proper atmosphere — one which forbids access to all 
others and escape to him, since only there can he bi^athe 
and range, and he alone can breathe and range there ; 
part to the frequent vapour that wraps his head and the 
frequent dust that soils his feet, filling the simpler sort 
with admiration of one so lofty at once and so familiar ; 
and part, I fear, to the quality which no other great poet 
ever shared or can share with him, to his inveterate and 
invincible Philistinism, his full community of spirit and 
faith, in certain things of import, with the vulgarest 
English mind — or that which with the Philistine does 
duty for a mind To those who like Shelley and Landor 
could see and mark this indomitable dullness and thickness of sense which made him mix with magnificent and 
flawless verse the "enormous foUy" of "those stupid 
staves," his pupils could always point out again the 
peculiar and imsurpassable grandeur and splendour of 
his higher mood ; and it was vain to reply that these 
could be seen and enjoyed without condonation or excuse 
of his violent and wearisome perversities. This is what 
makes his poetry such unwholesome and immoral reading 
for Philistines ; they can turn round upon their rebukers, 
and say, " Here is one of us who by your own admission 
is also one of the great poets ; '' and no man can give 
them the lie ; and the miserable men are confirmed in 
their faith and practice by the shameful triumph. 

It will be a curious problem for the critics of another 
age to work at, and if they can to work out, this influence of men more or less imbued with the savour and 
spirit of Philistia upon the moral Samson who has played 









MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS, 147 

for our behoof the part of Agonistes or protagonist in the 
new Gaza where we live. From the son of his father and 
the pupil of his teacher none would have looked for such 
efficient assault and battery of the Philistine outworks ; 
none but those who can appreciate the certain and 
natural force, in a strong and well-tempered spirit, of 
loyal and unconscious reaction. I say reaction, and not 
revolt ; he has assiuredly nothing of the bad, perhaps not 
enough of the good stuff, which goes to make a rebel. 
He is loyal, not to a &ult, but to the full ; yet no man's 
habit of mind or work can be less like that which men 
trained in other schools expect from a scholar of Rydal 
or of Rugby. A profane alien in my hearing once defined 
him as " David tlie son of Goliath ; " and when rebuked 
for the flat irreverence, avowed himself unable to imderstand how such a graft could have ever been set by the 
head gardener of the main hotbed of Philistine saplings 
now flourishing in England. It is certain that the opinion 
put forth with such flippant folly of phrase is common to 
many of the profane, and not explicable by mere puerile 
prejudice or sentiment ; and that students of Rugby or of 
Rydal, vocal and inarticulate, poetic and prosaic, are not 
seldom recognisable through certain qualities which, if 
any be, are undeniably Philistine. Whatever these 
schools have of good, their tendency is to cultivate all 
the merits recognised and suppress all the merits unrecognised in Ascalon or in Gath. I will not call up 
witnesses past or present from the realms of prose or 
verse, of practice or theory : it would be a task rather 
invidious than difficult

or Jephthah of our days, the man who has taught our 
h^ds to war and our fingers to fight against the 
Philistines, must as a poet have sat long and reverently 
at the feet of their Gamaliel And as when there is a 
high and pure genius on either side a man cannot but 
get good from the man he admires, and as it was so in 
this case if ever in any, he must have got good from that 
source over and above the certain and common good 
which the sense of reverence does to us all. The joy of 
worship, the delight of admiration, is in itself so excellent 
and noble a thing that even error cannot make it unvenerable or unprofitable ; no one need repeht of reverence, 
though he find flaws or cavities in his idol ; it has done 
him good to worship, though there were no godhead 
behind the shrine. To shut his eyes upon di^roof and 
affirm the presence of a god found absent, this indeed is 
evil; but this is not an act of reverence or of worship ; this is the brute fatuity of cowardice, the violent 
impotence of fear; wanting alike what is good and 
fruitful in belief and what is heroic and helpful in 
disbelief ; witness (for the most part) the religious and 
political, moral and sesthetic scriptures of our own time, 
the huge canonical roll of the Philistine. Nothing can 
\ be more unlike such ignoble and sluggard idolatry than the 
t reverence now expressed and now implied by Mr. Arnold 
.' for the doctrine and example of Wordsworth. His 
i memorial verses at once praise and judge the great poet 
; then newly dead better than any words of other men ; 
they have the still clear note, the fresh breath as of the 
first fields and birds of spring awakened in a serene dawn, 
which is in Wordsworth's own verse. With wider eyes

and keener, he has inherited the soothing force of speeqh 
and simple stroke of hand with which Wordsworth assuaged and healed the weariness and the wounds of his 
time ; to his hands the same appeasing spells and sacred 
herbs that fell from the other's when they relaxed in 
death have been committed by the gods of healing song. 
The elder physician of souls had indeed something too 
much of ^sculapius in him, something too Httle of 
Apollo his father ; nevertheless the lineal and legitimate 
blood was apparent 

This elegy and the poem headed " Resignation " are 
in my eyes the final flower of Mr. Arnold's poems after 
Wordsworth— as I take leave to qualify a certain division 
of his work. The second of these is an unspotted and 
unbroken model of high calm thought couched in pure 
and faultless words ; the words more equal and the vision 
more dear than his old teacher's, more just in view and 
more sure in grasp of nature and life. Imbued with the 
okl faith at once in the necessity of things and in the endurance of man, it excels in beauty and in charm the 
kindred song of Empedocles ; from first to last there 
rests upon it a serene spell, a sad supremacy of still music 
that softens and raises into wisdom the passionless and 
gentle pain of patience ; the charm of earth and sorrowful magic of things everlasting ; the spell that is upon 
the patient hills and immutable rocks, at work and asleep 
in " the life of plants and stones and rain " ; the life to 
which we too may subdue our souls and be wise. At 
times he writes simply as the elder poet might have 
written, without sensible imitation, but with absolute 
identity of style and sentiment ; at times his larger tone

of thought, his clearer accent of speech, attest the difference of the men. So perfect and sweet in speech, so 
sound and lucid in thought as the pupil is at his best, 
the master seldom was; and at his best the pupil is 
no more seen, and in his stead is a new master. He 
has nothing of Wordsworth's spirit of compromise with 
the nature of things, nothing of his moral fallacies and 
religious reservations ; he can sbe the face of facts and 
read them with the large and frank insight of ancient 
poets ; none of these ever had a more profound and 
serene sense of fate. But he has not grasped, and no 
man I suppose will ever grasp, the special and imperial 
sceptre of his elder. The incommunicable, the immitigable might of Wordsworth when the god has indeed 
faUen upon him cannot but be felt by all, and can but be 
felt by any ; none can partake or catch it up. There are 
many men greater than he ; there are men much greater ; 
but what he has of greatest is his only. His concentration, his majesty, his pathos have no parallel ; some have 
gone higher, many lower, none have touched precisely 
the same point as he \ some poets have had more of all 
these qualities, and better ; none have had exactly his 
gift. His pathos for instance cannot be matched against 
any other man's \ it is trenchant, and not tender ; it is an 
iron pathos. Take for example the most passionate of 
his poems, the " Affliction of Margaret ; " it is hard and 
fiery, dry and persistent as the agony of a lonely and a 
common soul which endures through life, a sufi^ng 
which runs always in one groove without relief or shift. 
Because he is dull and dry and hard, when set by the 
side of a great lyrist or dramatist ; because of these &ults

and defects, he is so intense and irresistible when his 
iron hand has hold of some chord which it knows 4iow to 
play upon. How utterly unlike his is the pathos of 
Homer or iEschylus, Chaucer or Dante, Shakespeare or 
Hugo ; all these greater poets feel the moisture and 
flame of the fever and the tears they paint ; their pathos 
when sharpest is full of sensitive life, of subtle tenderness, 
of playing pulses and melting colours \ his has but the 
downright and trenchant weight of swinging steel ; he 
strikes like the German headsman, one stroke of a loaded 
sword. This could not be done even by the poets who 
could do more and better than this. His metre too is 
sublime, his choice or chance of language casual or 
chosen has miraculous effects in it, when he feels his 
foot firm on ground fit for him ; otherwise his verse is 
often hard as wood and dry as dust and weak as water. 
In this as ill other ways his influence has been now good 
and now bad. The grave cadence of such a poem as 
the "Resignation," in this point also one of Mr. Arnold's 
most noble and effective, bears with it a memory and a 
resonance of the master's music, such as we find again 
in the lovely single couplets and lines which now and then 
lift up the mind or lull it in the midst of less excellent 
verse ; such for instance as these, which close a scale of 
lower melodies, in a poem not wholly or equally pleasurable : but these are faultless verses and fliU of the comfort of music, which tell us how, wafted at times from the 
fer-off verge of the soul, 

" As from an infinitely distant land. 
Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey 
A melancholy into all our day." 



152 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

These have a subtle likeness to Wordsworth's purer notes, 
a likeness undefined and unborrowed ; the use of words 
usually kept back for prose (such as " conrey ") is a trick 
of Wordsworth's which either makes or mars a passage ; 
here the touch, it may be by accident, strikes the exact 
chord wanted, elicits the exact tone. 

But indeed, as with all poets of his rank, so with Mr. 
Arnold, the technical beauty of his work is one with the spiritual ; art, a poet's art above all others, cannot succeed in 
this and fail in that Success or achievement of an exalted 
kind on the spiritual side ensures and enforces a like executive achievement or success; if the handiwork be 
flawed, there must also have been some distortion or 
defect of spirit, a shortcoming or a misdirection of spiritual 
supply. There is no such thing as a dumb poet or a 
handless painter. The essence of an artist is that he 
should be articulate. It is the mere impudence of weakness to arrogate the name of poet or painter with no 
other claim than a susceptible and impressible sense of 
outward or inward beauty, producing an impotent desire 
to paint or sing. The poets that are made by nature 
are not many ; and whatever '* vision " an aspirant may 
possess, he has not the '' faculty divine '' if he cannot use 
his vision to any poetic purpose. There is no cant more 
pernicious to such as these, more wearisome to all other 
men, than that which asserts the reverse. It is a drug 
which weakens the feeble and intoxicates the drunken ; 
which makes those swagger who have not learnt to walk, 
and teach who have not been taught to learn. Such talk 
as this of Wordsworth's is the poison of poor souls like

David Gra/s.* Men listen, and depart with the belief 
that they have this feculty or this vision which alone, 
they are told, makes the poet ; and once imbued with 
that belief, soon pass or slide from the inarticulate to the 
articulate stage of debility and disease. Aspiration 
foQed and impotent is a piteous thing enough, but friends

* This was a poor young Scotchman who may be remembered 
as having sought and found help and patronage at the hands first of 
Mr. Dobell and afterwards of Lord Houghton. In some of his 
sonnets there are touches of sweet and sincere emotion ; but the 
most remarkable points in his poor little book, and those which 
should be most memorable to other small poets of his kind (if at 
least the race of them were capable of profiting by any such lesson), 
are first the direct and seemingly unconscious transference of some 
of the best known lines or phrases from such obscure authors as 
Shakespeare and Wordsworth into the somewhat narrow and barren 
field of his own verse, and secondly the incredible candour of expression given in his correspondence to such flatulent ambition and 
such hysterical self-esteem as the author of ** Balder " must have 
regarded, I should think, with a sorrowfiil sense of amusement I 
may add that the poor boy's name was here cited with no desire to 
confer upon it any undeserved notoriety for better or for worse, and 
assuredly with no unkindlier feeling than pity for his poor little 
memory, but simply as conve3nng the most apt and the most flagrant 
as well as the most recent instance I happened to remember of the 
piteous and grievous harm done by false teaching and groundless 
encouragement to spirits not strong enough to know their own 
weakness. It was a kindly but uncritical reference in Mr. Arnold's 
kindly but uncritical essay on Maurice de Gu^rin — an essay of which 
I have said a few words further on — that upon this occasion for once 
recalled the name to my mind, and supplied me with the illustration 
required.

who feign to accq>t the will for the deed^ and treat inarticulate or inadequate pretenders as actual associates in art. 
The Muses can bear children and Apollo can give crowns 
to those only who are able to win the crown and b^et 
the child ; but in the school of theoretic sentiment it is 
apparently believed that this can be done by wishing. 

Small things suffice to give immediate proof or disproof of the requisite power. In music or in painting all 
men admit this for a truth ; it is not less certain in poetry. 
There is nothing in either of the poets I speak of more 
distinctive and significant than the excellence of their 
best sonnets. These are almost equally noble in style ; 
though the few highest of Wordsworth's remain out of 
reach of emulation, not out of sight of worship. Less 
adorable and sublime, not less admirable and durable, 
Mr. Arnold's hold their own in the same world of poetry 
with these. All in this new volume are full of beauty, 
sound and sweet fruits of thought and speech that have 
ripened and brought forth together ; the poetry of religious 
thought when most pure and most laige has borne no 
fairer than that one on the drawing in the Catacombs ot 
the Good Shepherd bearing the young, not of a sheep, 
but of a goat ; or that other on the survival of grace and 
spirit when the body of belief lies dead ; but all, I repeat, 
have a singular charm and clearness. I have used diis 
word already more than once or twice ; it comes nearest 
of all I can find to the thing I desire to express ; that 
natural light of mind, that power of reception and reflection of things or thoughts, which I most admire in so 
much of Mr. Arnold's work. I mean by it much more 
than mere facility or transparency ; more than brilliance. 






MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 155 

more than ease or excellence of style. It is a quality 
begotten by instinct upon culture ; one which all artists of 
equal rank possess in equal measure. 

There are in the English language three elegiac 
poems so great that they eclipse and efface all the elegiac 
poetry we know ; all of Italian, all of Greek. It is only 
because the latest bom is yet new to us that it can seem 
strange or rash to say so. The " Thyrsis " of Mr. Arnold 
makes a third with " Lycidas " and " Adonais." It is 
not so easy as those may think who think by rote and 
praise by prescription to strike the balance between 
them. The first however remains first, and must remain 5 
its five opening lines are to me the most musical in all 
known realms of verse ; there is nothing like them ; and 
it is more various, more simple, more laige and sublime 
than the others ; lovelier and fuller it cannot be. 

** The leader is fairest, 
But all are divine.'* 

The least pathetic of the three is "Adonais,** which 
indeed is hardly pathetic at all ; it is passionate, subtle, 
splendid ; but ** Th)a^," like " Lycidas," has a quiet and 
tender undertone which gives it something of sacred. 
Shelley brings fire from heaven, but these bring also " the 
meed of some melodious tear." There is a grace ineffable, 
a sweet sound and sweet savour of diings past, in the 
old beautifiil use of the language of shepherds, of flocks 
and pipes; the spirit is none tlie less sad and sincere 
because the body of the poem has put on this dear 
familiar raiment of romance; because the crude and 
naked sorrow is veiled and chastened with soft shadows 



156 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

and sounds of a "land that is very far oflf " ; because the 
verse remembers and retains a perfume and an echo of 
Grecian flutes and flowers, 

" Renews the golden world, and holds through all 
The holy laws of homely pastoral, 
Where flowers and founts, and nymphs and semi-gods, 
And all the jGraces find their old abodes/' 

Here, as in the " Scholar Gipsy," the beauty, the 
delicacy and aflluence of colour, the fragrance and the 
freedom as of wide wings of winds in summer over 
meadow and moor, the freshness and expansion of the 
light and the lucid air, the spring and the stream as of 
flowing and welling water, enlarge and exalt the pleasure 
and power of the whole poem. Such English-coloured 
verse no poet has written since Shakespeare, who chooses 
his field-flowers and hedgerow blossoms with the same 
sure and loving hand, binds them in as simple and sweet 
an order. All others, from Milton downward to Shelley 
and onward from him, have gathered them singly or have 
mixed them with foreign buds and alien bloom. No 
poem in any language can be more perfect as a model of 
style, unsurpassable certainly, it may be unattainable. 
Any couplet, any line proves it No countryman of ours 
since Keats died has made or has found words fall into 
such faultless folds and forms of harmonious line. He is 
the most efficient, the surest-footed poet of our time, the 
most to be relied on ; what he does he is the safest to do 
weU; more than any other he imites personality and 
perfection ; others are personal and imperfect, perfect 
and impersonal ; with them you must sometimes choose 
between inharmonious freedom and harmonious bond-

age. Above all, he knows what as a poet he should do, 
and simply does that ; the manner of his good work is 
never more or less than right; his verse comes clean 
and fiiU out of the mould, cast at a single jet ; placed 
beside much other verse of the time, it shows like a 
sculptor's work by an enameller's. Witli all their wealth 
and warmth of flowers and lights, these two twin poems 
are solid and pure as granite or as gold. Their sweet 
sufiiciency of music, so full and calm, buoys and bears up 
throughout the imperial vessel of thought Their sadness 
is not chill or sterile, but as the sorrow of summex; pausing 
with laden hands on the middle height of the year, the 
watershed that divides the feeding fountains of autumn 
and of spring ; a grave and fruitful sadness, the triumphant 
melancholy of full-blown flowers and souls full-grown. 
The stanzas from the sixth to the fourteenth of " Thyrsis," 
and again from the sixteenth to the twentieth, are if 
possible the most lovely in either poem ; the deepest in 
tone and amplest in colour ; the choiceness and sweetness of single lines and phrases most exquisite and 
frequent 

" O easy access to the hearer's grace, 

When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine ! 

For she herself had trod Sicilian fields, 
She knew the Dorian water's gush divine, 

She knew each lily white which Enna yields, 
Each rose with blushing face ; 
She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian strain. 

But, ah ! of our poor Thames she never heard ! 

Her foot the Cumnor cowslips never stirred ; 
And we should tease her with our plaint in vain." 

She has learnt to know them now, the river and the rivermeadows, and access is as easy for an English as a Dorian

prayer to the most gentle of all worshipped gods. It is a 
triumphal and memorial poem, a landmark in the high 
places of verse to which future traveUers studious of Ae 
fruits and features of the land may turn and look up and 
see what English hands could rear. 

This is probably the highest point of Mr. Arnold's 
poetry, though for myself I cannot wholly resign the old 
preference of things before familiar; of one poem in 
especial, good alike for children and men, the ^' Forsaken 
Merman ; " which has in it the pathos of natural things, 
the tune of the passion we fancy in the note of crying birds 
or winds weeping, shrill and sweet and estranged from 
us ; the swift and winged wail of something lost midway 
between man's life and the life of things souUess, the wail 
overhead and caught up by the fitful northern fency, filling 
with glad and sad spirits the untravelled ways of nature ; 
the clear cry of a creature astray in the world, wild and 
gentle and mournful, heard in the sighing of weary waters 
\ before dawn under a low wind, in the rustle and ^istle 
y and whisper of leaves or grasses, in the long light breaths 
of twilight air heaving all the heather on the hills, in the 
coming and going of the^sorrowful strong seas that bring 
delight and death, in the tender touch and recoil of the 
ripple firom the sand ; all the fanciful pitiful beauty of 
dreams and legends born in grey windy lands oil shores 
and hill-sides whose life is quiet and wild. No man's hand 
has pressed fifom the^lls and buds of the moors and 
downs by cape or channel of the north a sweeter honey 
than this. The song is a piece of the sea-wind, a stray 
breath of the air and bloom of the bays and hills : its 
mixture of mortal sorrow with the strange wild sense of a 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 159 

life that is not after mortal law — the childlike moan after 
lost love mingling with the pure outer note of a song not 
human — the look in it as of bright bewildered eyes with 
tears not theirs and alien wonder in the watch of them — 
the tender, marveUous, simple beauty of the poem, its 
charm as of a soimd or a flower of the sea — set it and save 
it apart from all others in a niche of the memory. This 
has all the inexplicable inevitable sweetness of a child's or 
a bird's in its note ; ** Thyrsis " has all the accomplished 
and adult beauty of a male poem. In the volume which 
it crowns there is certainly no new jewel of equal water. 
" Palladium " is a fresh sample of the noble purity and 
clearness which we And always and always praise in his 
reflective poetry ; its cool aerial colour like that of a quiet 
sky between full simset and full moonrise, made ready 
for the muster of the stars, swept clean of cloud and flame, 
and laved with limpid unruffled air from western green to 
eastern grey ; a sky the cenotaph of unburied sunlight, 
the mould of moonlight unborn. " A Southern Night " 
is steeped in later air, as gentle and more shining ; the 
stanzas on the Grande Chartreuse are stamped with the 
impression of a solemn charm, and so the new verses on 
Obermann,^ the new verses on Marguerite, strange to read 

* Among these the stanzas on the advent of Christianity, of " the 
Mother with the Child," and their enduring life while only £aith in 
them endured, recall the like passage, more thoughtful and fruitful 
still, in that wise and noble poem, Mr. W. B. Scott's ** Year of the 
'World " ; a poem to whose great qualities and affluent beauties of 
letter and of spirit the requisite and certain justice of time remains 
hitherto a debt unpaid. Its author must divide with Mr. Arnold 
the palm of intellectual or philosophic poetry, the highest achieved 
in England since Wordsworth, and in many things of moment 
hitler than his.

for those who remember reading the first at the time when 
all the loves we read of assume a form and ascend a throne 
in our thoughts, the old and the new side by side, so that 
now this poem comes under our eyes like a new love-song 
of Petrarca to Laura or Coleridge to Genevifeve. It is 
fine and high in tone, but not such as the famous verses, 
cited and admired even by critics sparing of their priceless 
praise, beginning 

"Yes, in this sea of life enisled — ." 

These in their profound and passionate calm strike deeper 
and soimd fuller than any other of the plaintive dejected 
songs of Switzerland. " Dover Beach " marks another 
high point in the volume ; it has a grand choral cadence 
as of steady surges, regular in resonance, not fitfiil or gusty 
but antiphonal and reverberate. But nothing of new verse 
here clings closer to the mind than the overture of that 
majestic fragment firom the chorus of a " Dejaneira." 

" O frivolous mind of man, 
Light ignorance, and hurrying, unsure thoughts, 
Though man bewails you not, 
How I bewail you ! '* 

We must hope to have more of the tragedy in time ; 
that must be a noble statue which could match this massive 
fiiagment The story of Merope, though dramatic enough 
in detail, is upon the whole more of a narrative romance 
than a tragic subject ; in Mr. Arnold's poem the deepest 
note is that struck by the tyrant Polyphontes, whose 
austere and patient figure is carved with Sophoclean 
skill of hand. It is a poem which Milton might have 
praised, an august work, of steady aim and severe success ; 
but this of Dejaneira has in it a lofder promise and a 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS, i6i 

larger chance. Higher matter of tragedy there can be 
none ; none more intense and impressive, none fuller ot 
keen and profound interest, none simpler and statelier ; 
Done where the weight and gravity, the sweetness and 
shapeliness of pure thought, could be better or closeUer 
allied with the warmth and width of common tenderness 
and passion. We must all hope that the poet will keep 
to this clear air of the ancient heights, more natural and 
wholesome for the spirit than the lowlands of depression 
and dubiety where he has set before now a too frequent 
foot This alone I find profitless and painful in his work ; 
this occasional habit of harking back and loitering in mind 
among the sepulchres. Nothing is to be made by an 
artist out of scepticism, half-hearted or double-hearted 
doubts or creeds j nothing out of mere dejection and 
misty mental weather. Tempest or calm you may put to 
use, but hardly a flat fog. In not a few of his former 
poems^ in some reprinted here, there is a sensible and 
stagnant influence of moist vapour firom those marshes of 
the mind where weaker ^uls paddle and plunge and dis- 
^pear. Above these levels the sunnier fields and fi-esher 
uplands lie wide and warm ; and there the lord of the 
land should sit at peace among his good things. If a 
spirit by nature dear and high, a harmonious and a shining 
soul, does ever feel itself "immured in the hot prison of 
the present," its fit work is not to hug but break its chain ; 
and only by its own will or weakness can it remain ill at 
ease in a thick and difficult air. Of such poetry I would 
say what Joubert, as cited by Mr. Arnold, sa)rs of all coarse 
and violent literature: it may be produced in any amount 
of supply to any excess of effect, but it is no proper 

M 



i62 MATTHEW ARNOLD* S NEW POEMS. 

matter of pure art, and " the soul says all die while, You 
hurt me." Deep-reaching doubt and "large discourse'* 
are poetical ; so is faith, so are sorrow and joy ; but so 
are not the small troubles of spirits that nibble and quibble 
about beliefis living or dead \ so are not those sickly moods 
which are warmed and weakened by feeding on the sullen 
drugs of dejection ; and the savour of this disease and its 
medicines is enough to deaden the fresh air of poetry. 
Nothing which leaves us depressed is a true work of art 
We must have light though it be lightning, and air though 
it be storm. 

Where the thought goes wrong, the verse follows after 
it In Mr. Arnold's second book there was more of weak 
or barren matter, and more therefore of feeble or &ulty 
metre. Rhyme is the native condition of lyric verse in 
EngUsh ; a rhymeless lyric is a maimed thing, and halts 
and stanmiers in the deHvery of its message. There are 
some few in the language as good as, rare ; but the habit 
or rule is ' bad. The fragments of his " Antigone " and 
" Dejaneira " no reader can wish other than they are ; 
and the chorus for example in " Merope " which tells- ot 
Areas and Callisto is a model of noble form and colour; 
but it does not fasten at once upon the memory like a 
song of Callides, or like the " Merman," or like any such 
other. To throw away the natural grace of rhyme from 
a modem song is a wilful abdication of half the power 
and half the charm of verse. It is hard to realise and 
hopeless to reproduce the musical force of classic metres 
so recondite and exquisite as the choral parts of a Greek 
play. Even Milton could not ; though with his godlike 
instinct and his godlike might of hand he made a kind 



• J — i—^ 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 163 

of strange and enormous harmony by intermixture of assonance and rhyme with irregular blank verse, as in that 
last Titanic chorus of Samson which utters over the fallen 
Philistines the tnmipet-blast and thunder of its triumph. 
But Milton, it may be said, even if he knew them, did not 
obey the laws of the choral scheme, and so forfeited the 
legitimate condition of its music Who then has observed 
those laws and obtained that success which he did not ? 
I scarcely think that Mr. Arnold has ; and if ever man 
was qualified for the work it is he only. I have never 
seen other attempts at rhymeless choral metre which were 
not mere amorphous abortions of misshapen prose, halting 
on helpless broken limbs and feet. A poet of Mr. Arnold's 
high station cannot of course but write in verse, and in 
good verse as far as the kind will allow ; but that is not 
far enough to attain the ultimate goal, to fill up the final 
measure of delight We lose something of the glory and 
the joy of poetry, of which he has no reason and no right 
tp defraud us. It is in no wise a question of scholarship, 
or in the presence of a scholar I should be silent ; as it 
is, I must say how inexplicable it seems to me that Mr. 
Arnold, of all men, should be a patron of En^ish hexameters. His own I have tried in vain to reduce by 
scansion into any metrical feet at all; they look like 
nothing on earth, and sound like anapaests broken up and 
driven wrong ; neither by ear nor by finger can I bring 
them to any reckoning. I am sure of one thing, that , 
some of them begin with a pure and absolute anapaest ; 
and how a hexameter can do this it passes my power to 
conceive. And at best what ugly bastards of verse are 
these self-styled hexameters ! how human tongues or

1 64 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

hands could utter or could write them except by way of 
burlesque improvisation I could never imagine, and never 
shall. Once only, to be candid — and I will for once show 
all possible loyalty and reverence to past authority— once 
only, as far as I know, in Dr. Hawtre/s delicate and 
fluent verse, has the riddle been resolved ; the verses are 
faultless, are English, are hexametric ; but that is simply 
a graceful interlude of pastime, a well-played stroke in a 
game of skill played with language. Such as pass elsewhere for English hexameters I do hope and suppose 
impossible to Eton. Mr. Clough's I will not presume 
to be serious attempts or studies in any manner of metre ; 
they are admirable studies in graduated prose, full of fine 
sound and effect Even Mr. Kingsle/s "Andromeda," 
the one good poem extant in that pernicious metre, for 
all its spirit and splendour, for all the grace and glory 
and exultation of its rushing and ringing words, has not 
made possible the impossible thing. Nothing but loose 
rhymeless anapaests can be made of the language in that 
way ; and we hardly want these, having infinite command 
and resource of metre without them, and rhyme thrown 
in to turn the overweighted scale. I am unwilling to set 
my face against any doctrine or practice of a poet such 
as Mr. Arnold, but on this matter of metre I was moved 
to deliver my souL 
\/ This is not the only example in his writings of some 
quality which seems to me intrusive and incoherent with 
his full general accuracy and clearness. These points of 
view and heads of theory which in my eyes seem out <^ 
perspective do indeed cohere each with the other ; but 
hardly with hb own high practice and bright intuition of

the best thing. His alliance is so precious against the 
mailed and gowned array of the Philistines, that the least 
defection, the least error of movement, imperils more 
than his own position ; a whole regiment may be misled 
into ruin by the general, while the heat and burden ot 
the day lie before us yet No man has done so much to 
exalt and to correct men's view of the higher criticism and 
its office. Wherever therefore in things great or small he 
outmns or falls short of the immediate goal of a just 
judgment, the instant aim of a pure argument, it is 
worth while to take note of the slippeiy or oblique 
reasoning, or at least to sift and strain it, on the chance 
that here may be some error. " The light of the body is 
the eye ; " he is the eye of English criticism ; and if ever 
for some passing purblind minute the light that is in that 
body be darkness, how great indeed is that darkness ! 
Dark however he properly never is, but I think at times 
oblique or drowsy. He has smitten the Janus of Philistine worship on one face ; under the other, if he has not 
himself burnt a pinch or two of adulterate incense, he 
has encouraged or allowed others to bum. At the portal 
by which English devotees press thickest into the 
temple of Dagon he has stood firm as in a breach, and 
done good service; but he has left unguarded other 
points of entrance. All that is said in his essays on the 
religious tradition and the religious idea, as opposed to 
Philistine demolition or to Philistine edification, I accept 
and admire as truth, exceUent if not absolute, and suggestive if not final ; but firom his own vantage ground of 
meditation and idea I start my objection to this inference 
and that Protestantism, conservative and destructive, 



1 66 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS, 

is the form in which the enemy has appeared to him ; 
such in his eyes has been the banner, such the watchword under which they serve. All Philistia for him is 
resumed in the English Philistine ; who may probably be 
the most noisome example in the world, but is assuredly 
not the only one. I do not say that marriage dissoluble 
only in an English divorce court is a lovely thing or a 
venerable ; I do say that marriage indissoluble except by 
Papal action is not It is irrelevant and un^ir for a 
soldier of light to ally himself with Philistine against 
Philistine. From the ideal point of meditation to which 
he would recall us, where the pure justice and the naked 
beauty of thought are alone held sacred, I cannot ^ find 
the marriage theory of Catholicism refreshing and elevating " merely because the Protestant* theory, which 
" neither makes divorce impossible nor makes it decent," 
has assumed in En^ish law-courts a gross and hideous 
incarnation. What is anomalous, what is unjust, cannot 
surely be beautiful to purged eyes looking from '' the 
ideal sphere." Of course the idea of a lifelong union has 
its beauty and significance ; so has the idea of liberty and 
sincerity of action. Faith is good, and freedom is good ; 
the office of the idea is to give firee play and full justice to 
both. The Philistines on either side would fain draw 
sharper and harder the lines of demarcation and division ; 
the thinkers on neither side would fain not reject but 
reconcile. 

Again, it is doubtless the best and most direct service 
that a critic can do his countrymen to strip and smite 
their especial errors, to point out and fence off their 
peculiar pitfalls ; and this Mr. Arnold has done for his 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 167 

English not once or twice only. I doubt if he has ever 
assailed or advised them widiout due cause : in one 
point above all he has done them most loyal and liberal 
service ; he has striven to purge them of the pestilence 
of provincial thought and tradition, of blind theory and 
brute opinion, of all that hereditary policy of prejudice 
vdiich substitutes self-esteem for self-culture, self-worship 
for self-knowledge ; which clogs and encrusts all powers 
and all motions of the mind with a hard husk of 
mechanical conceit And here, heaven knows, in his 
dull dumb way the Briton stands ahead of all men, 
towers above all men in stolid and sublime solitude, a 
massive, stupid, inarticulate god and priest in one ; his 
mute and majestic autolatry is a deeper and more radical , 
religion than the self-love of other nations, the more 
vocal vanities oi France or America. In the stone walls 
and iron girders of this faith our champion has done what 
a man may to make a breach ; and the weapon was 
well chosen, the brand of provinciality, wherewith to 
stamp and mark that side of the double-faced head of 
Dagon which looks towards us with English features. 
But, to use his own term, there are two notes of provinciality perceptible, one or other, in most criticism 
qS foreign things ; error in praise and error in dispraise. 
He could have prescribed for the soul-sick British Philistine, " sick of self-love," no better method of cure than 
study and culture of the French spirit, of its flexible 
intelligence and critical ambition, its many-sided foith in 
perfection, in possible excellence and ideal growth outward and upward, and the single-hearted love of all these 
which goes hand in hand with that faith. Faith in light 



i68 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

and motion is what England has not and France has ; often 
a blind, erring, heretical faith, often perverse and fanatical, a faith which kills its prophets and stones its protomartyrs ; but in art as in politics, in literature as in ethics, 
an active and a living ^th. To show this to English 
eyes and impress upon English ears its trudi and its importance is to do a good work ; but to pass from general 
doctrine to example and detail is hard and unsafe for a 
foreign preacher. Those who deserve gratitude at our 
hands deserve also candour ; and I must in candour say 
that Mr. Arnold is not a sure guide over French ground. 
He does not know quite how the land lies : he turns 
down this declivity or stops rfiort by that well-head, 
where a native guide would hardly bid one halt With a 
large and fine appreciation of the beauties and capacities 
of the national character, with a justice and strength of 
insight into these which compared with an average 
English judgment are wonderful and admirable, he has 
not the eyes and the nerves of one to the manner bom, 
the sudden and sensitive intuition of an innate instinct : 
he thinks right, but he feels wrong ; some men are right 
without being reasonable, he is reasonable without being 
right He sets up a rational argument to prove why 
France should be, and why she is, weak in poetry and 
strong in prose ; a very keen and clear argument, only 
the facts are all against it Of classic verse Mr. Arnold 
is so much more competent to speak than I am that I 
dare not press the debateable question of choric metre ; 
but of French verse I must have leave to say that he is not 
competent to speak. His touch has in it no pulse or 
play of French blood ; his fine ear is deaf on that side.

It would clearly be impossible to show him, to make him 
feel, the silent horror and wonder with which other ears 
receive such utterances from him as from the common 
Briton we expect and accept with all composure. 
Whether it be " the German paste in his composition " 
which so far thickens and deadens his subtle sense of 
song, I cannot say; but I can say that in that case it 
would be well for him to get quit of it The cadence 
and impulse of harmonies in French verse are of course 
unlike those in English verse or Italian, and the laws 
which are their outgrowth are unlike too ; but the one is 
not more sure and satisfying than the other : only there 
must be the right hands to play and the right ears to hear. 
Mr. Arnold says that a Frenchman bom with the faculty 
or instinct of poetry finds in prose a fuller and easier expression than in verse. As justly might a French critic 
say this of an Englishman. In either case, the man who 
is a poet or nothing must be judged by his power of 
writing verse. If he can neither do that well nor do any 
other work, whatever his charm of aspiration and sentiment and sincerity may be, he slips into the second 
rank as surely if French as if English. Imagine that 
Frenchman's tone of mind, or his tone of ear, who should 
proclaim the inadequacy of a language which has sufficed 
for all the great lyric poets of France, all the copious and 
l^orious roll firom Frangois Villon and Charles of Orleans 
to Victor Hugo and Thdophile Gautier, but is now convicted of inaptitude to render in full the sentiments of a 
Maurice de Gu6rin ! The English poet is here hopelessly at sea without oar or rudder, haven or guiding-star. 
He cannot even be trusted to speak of the academic

poets, easier though they are of access and apj^ehension 
even to the run of E^lishmen. The thin, narrow, 
shallow, but very real melodies of Racine are as inaudible 
to him as the mightier symphonies of the great school ; 
this perhaps, as he says, is natural in a foreigner. But 
no such excuse will serve for the confusion of judgment 
which places on a level the very best man of his kind, 
Pope, and Boileau, the very worst Perhaps their respective Odes on St Cecilia's Day and the Siege of 
Namur may be allowed to pair off as the shamefullest 
two lyrical poems in the world; but compare for a 
moment their general work, their didactic and satirical 
verse ! the comparison is an insult too absurd to affect 
the Englishman. He is the finest, Boileau the dullest 
craftsman of their age and school 

It is singular and significant that Mr. Arnold, himself 
estabUshed and acknowledged as a poet standing in the 
first rank among his own people, has chosen for special 
praise and patronage men who have tried their hands at 
his work and failed, men who have fallen back baffled 
firom the cliff-side he has climbed. Again I cite the evidence of his French critic ; who naturally feels that he has 
paid the Frej^ch but a poor compliment in praising as 
their best men those who fall short of their own aim and

The gentle pupil of Lamennais is to Mr. Arnold 
what the lesser celandine was to Wordsworth : he has 
unearthed a new favourite, and must have some three or 
four who will love his littie flower. It were churlish and 
foolish to refuse ; the small petals are fresh and dewy, 
the slim stem bends and sways with a sylvan grace. But 
it is something too much to hold up. a bit of pilewort as 
the rose of Sharon ; it provokes one to deny the poor 
blossom a place among flowers at all : it is indecorous 
and ludicrous. The ^'Centaur" is really so fine and 
graceful a little study, there are really such delicate and

distinctive touches of expression and feeling, such traces 
of a bright clear sense of beauty and chami and meaning 
in nature, that it was but just, when the man was well 
dead and could get no good of it and no harm, to praise 
him without grudging and pick up his leavings as a 
windfall A place in the cabinet of M. Sainte-Beuve was 
no more than his desert. But the place which Mr. 
Arnold assigns him is reserved for men far other than 
this tender dreamer : five minutes of their life outweigh 
five centuries of such lives as his; one breath of the 
common air of their spirit would bum up the little 
tremulous soul as with fire. No tender Semele, but the 
queen of heaven alone, can face and enjoy the lightning 
of heaven. Of the contact of mortal and immortal, ashes 
are the only fruits. In Keats there was something of the 
spirit and breath of the world, of the divine life of things ; 
in Gu^rin there was hardly a soft breathless pulse of fluttering sympathy ; here was the anima mundi^ made flesh 
once more in the body of a divine interpreter such as all 
great poets must be after their kind ; there was the 
animula vaguiay blandula^ of a tentative, sensitive, impressible nature ; fiiU of little native pieties and sincere 
little sensibilities, amiable and laudable enough. But the 
demigods of our kind are not cast in such clay as that. 
M. Sainte-Beuve knew better than Mr. Arnold what was 
the rank and what the kindred of their foster-child when 
he called him a latter-day Lakist If we must needs 
find him kinsmen among English poets, he may take his 
stand as a subordinate in the school of Gray* or the

says of Gray that he never used the popular metre of his century,

household of Cowper. With them he had some good 
things in common ; his letters, if less worth reading than 
the best of theirs, have the same frank delicacy and 
gentle play of personal sentiment applied to the landscape 
or the hearthside, and couched sometimes in choice and 
excellent words. But Keats, of all men bom the ablest 
to hold his own with nature, and translate her gods into 
verbal incarnation; Keats, who was at once the lyrist 
and the lyre of that nature, the priest and the altar of 
those gods ; more than all other poets receptive and 
passive of her influences and forces, and more than all 
other poets able and active to turn them aU to a divine 
use, to transfigure them without transformation, to attune 
all colours and attemper all harmonies ; whose power 
upon these things, whose gift of transfusion and expression, places him apart from all in his sovereign command 
of nature, able to do for nature what in his own day 
Shelley could not achieve nor Wordsworth attempt; 
above all Greece and all Italy and all England in his own 
line and field of work ; to push forward as a competitor 
with him in that especial field of work where all the giants 
and all the gods of art would fail to stand against him for 
an hour, a man who in his own crafl could not use 
the tools that lay ready to his hand — ^who was nothing

against the judgment which ranks him as a poet above Collins, the 
man of all his age, it seems to me, who had most in him of the pure 
and high and durable spirit of poetry. The overture of his Ode to 
liberty is worthy of Coleridge or Shelley ; Gray's best ode by its 
side b somewhat hard and tlun. 



174 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

himself a poet by writing passable verse at all ; this is a 
madness of mistake exphcable and excusable only as the 
error of a foreign and provincial judgment Any stanza of 
" Thyrsis," any fragment of " Callicles," would outweigh 
in point of " natural magic " all Gu6in's work, even were 
his thoughts clothed in the beauty of verse instead of the 
prettiness of prose ; to weigh against it the entire work 
of Keats, or any such single poem as the *^ Ode to 
Psyche " or that " on a Grecian Urn " — ^poems which for 
perfect apprehension and execution of all attainable in 
their own sphere would weigh down all the world ot 
poetry — is inexpressibly impossible. 

Sweeping aside all this accumulated panegyric, we 
may discern the modest attraction of Gu^rin's little plot 
of ground with its borders of crocus and snowdrop ; 
though the gardeners have done their best to kill them with 
hothouse fumes and water-pipes and bell-glasses. As to 
his first posthumous patroness — ^he belongs to the breed 
of those suckling poets who live on patronage premature 
even when posthiunpus — I must say with another critic, 
^' Madame Sand n'est vraiment pas heureuse en poetes ; Z 
great and excellent as she is, their contact is not good 
for her. Assuredly the one aspiration of Gu^rin, his one 
desire that ''a stronger soul would bow down to his 
weaker spirit," has since his death been somewhat too 
much fulfilled A niche in the Sainte-Beuve collection is 
his due ; but not the homage of Geoige Sand and Matthew Arnold. His sister and he had in effect a certain 
distinction, they had gracefiil tastes and tunable minds : 
without distinction there cannot be genius, but there cannot be genius with nothing else ; a man cannot live on air 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 175 

because he cannot live without it Mr. Arnold would set 
them as stars in heaven, lucida sidera ; their little lights 
will hardly bum the night out, but meantime they shine 
well enough for children to watch them twinkle and 
"wonder what they are." Without a glimpse of genius, 
without more light or strength of spirit than many others 
unknown, Mile, de Gudrin shows always a beautiful and 
admirable soul ; her diary and her letters have more than 
usual of the lovely and loving qualities of good women, true 
sisters and gentle wives, faithful and fervent and worthy to 
receive again the lavish love they give ; they never would 
come forward, they need never be thrust forward, as genius 
or as saint The immortal women in either kind — St 
Theresa, St Catherine, Vittoria Colonna, Mrs. Browning, 
Miss Christina Rossetti — belong to a different world and 
scheme of things. With one verse or one word of theirs 
any one of these could have absorbed and consumed her 
as a sunbeam of the fieiy heaven a dewdrop of the 
dawning earth.* Nor, to repass for an instant from the 
personal to the religious question started from this cover 
by Mr. Arnold, is it just or rational to oppose to her 
delicate provincial piety the coarsest and ugliest form of 

' If you would see the note of distinction between religious genius 
tnd religions talent, compare with any of Mile, de Gu^rin's idyllic 
efiiisioiis of gracious piety, fresh and sweet in their small way as the 
dusk and the dew, the great new-year hymn of Miss Rossetti, 

" Passing away, saith the world, passing away," 

so much the noblest of sacred poems in our language that there is 
none which comes near it enough to stand second ; a hymn touched 
as with the fire and bathed as in the light of sunbeams, tuned as to 
diords and cadences of refluent sea-music beyond reach of harp and 
(ngan, large echoes of the serene and sonorous tides of heaven.

English &ith. There are graceful as well as loathsome 
forms of Protestantism, loathsome as well as graceful 
forms of Catholicism : probably the balance is about 
even. The Christ of Clapham is an ungracious god 
enough ; the time is not fruitful of gods in any degree 
adorable ; but the Christ of Montrouge? Exeter Hall is 
not a wise or lovely oracle ; but what of Saint-Acheul ? 
Is there any more of grace, of light, of culture or sweetness, imder the banner of M. Veuillot than on the staff 
of the Record? There lies the question ; not between 
T^nguedoc and Margate. Against the best of one creed 
it is but fair to set the best of another, against the worst 
the worst As to culture, sanity, power of grasp and reception. Mile, de Gu^rin hesitating at the brink of Hugo 
is assuredly as pitiable as any Puritan shuddering on the 
verge of Shakespeare. 

Again, Mr. Arnold has a fond faith in the French 
Academy and in the Revue des Deux Mandes which is 
nothing short of pathetic ; he seems actually to take them 
at their own valuation. The too outspoken critic before 
cited ventures to express in ribald phrase his wonder that 
such a pair of " hoarse and haggard old temptresses " 
{vieilles teniatrices h&ves et rauques) should play the part 
of Delilah to the scouiger of Philistines. Not, as he 
adds, that he would impugn the venerable maiden reputation of their hoary hairs ; but such as they are, 
"ces ^tranges s^uctrices ont failli couper de leurs 
ciseaux ^mouss^s les cheveux au Samson anglais. D^jk

devant cette Diilcinfe k quarante. II est Famaiit fougueox du bon sens, Tapotre ^chauff<^ de la froide raison, 
Favocat furibond du go^t sain." This is not a fair or 
clear judgment ; it is indigested and violent and deformed 
in expression ; but it shows as in a cracked and blurred 
mirror the reflection thrown upon other minds by Mr. 
Arnold's act of homage in the outer courts of the 
Philistine temple : for thither he has unwittingly turned, 
and there has bent his knee, as no Frenchman could have 
done who was not a Philistine bom and baptised and 
branded to the bone with the signet of the sons of Dagon. 
We may grant that the real office of an Academy should 
be— what the nominal office of this Academy is — culture 
and perfection of intelligence, elevation of the general 
standard of work, the average of mind and taste and 
sense which precludes absurdity or aberration and ensures 
something of care and conscience among the cr aftsmen of 
literature. Greater work an ideal Academy could hardly 
undertake, for greater work would require the vivid and 
personal advent of genius ; and that, I presume, it could 
hardly imdertake to supply. But has the actual Academy 
done this ? Whom has it controlled, whom has it impelled, who but for such influence would either have 
gone wrong or failed to go right ? whom at least among 
men really memorable and precious? Has it constantly 
done homage to the best ? has it constantly rejected or 
rebuked the worst ? Is it to the Academy that wfe owe 
the sound judgment, taste, temperance of the French 
prose classics whom Mr. Arnold eloquently extols?

the still virgin machinery of his engine against the greater 
Corneille? What was Molifere in its eyes? and what 
was not Boileau ? Where now are its great men, in an 
age for France so fruitful of literary greatness ? Does it 
include one of high and fine genius besides M^rim^e ? 
and do the rest of the sacred forty respect in him the 
official antiquary or the faultless writer on whose dawn 
Goeihe looked out and prophesied overmuch? There 
are names indeed still greater on its roll, but you do 
not see appended to them the academic title. Once 
for all,, waiving its mere theories and reserving its mere 
pretensions, let us inquire if in effect it now does, if 
it ever has done, if it ever will do, any real and good 
service whatever to pure literature ? The advice which 
Mr. 4mold gives by implication to his English audience 
while preaching on the text of academies is predous 
and necessary in itself, if the mass of English literature now current or floating is ever to be in any 
measure elevated or purified ; but the selection of text 
is merely fantastic, the process of deduction vicious 
and baseless. This double impression was made on me 
by the lecture when I heard it delivered at Oxford ; I 
have read it since more than once, and the impression is 
strengthened and deepened. It is possible to start from 
some incongruous or ignorant assumption and yet proceed 
to speak words of truth and soberness ; the sermon may 
be usefiil and noble though the text be strained and misapplied. For the Rtime des Deux Mondes I have as 
earnest a respect as Mr. Arnold ; so far from regarding it 
with the eyes of irreverence and ribaldry, as an old lady 
of pleasure, a Delilah of dangerously gay repute, the ideas 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 179 

of pleasure or gaiety are the last I should associate with a 
name so justly venerated, a fame so sound and round and 
solid. Rather would I regard it, as the author of 
"Mademoiselle de Maupin" used tq regard virtue in the 
days which found him unambitious of academic eminence, 
with such eyes as turn towards a fond and watchful grandmother. It is dangerous to ruffle the robe of that dowager. 
But I cannot regard her bosom as a safe pillow for the yet 
unshorn head of a Nazarite champion. Too many of the 
uncircumcised Philistines lie in wait for him slumbering in 
the lap of M. Buloz. Are thete not giants among them, 
and the sons of the old giant, all of them children of 
uncircumcision ? and the least of these has twice the thews 
and seven times the wits of the heavy-headed homy-eyed 
English Philistine. Some of them there are that sleep 
with their father Goliath, and some abide to this day ; 
and the acts of them past and present, and all that they 
did, and their might, are they not written in the books of 
the Revue des Deux Mondesi There is M. Gustave 
Planche, the staff of whose spear was so very like a 
weaver's beam ; there is M. Armand de Pontmartin, a 
man of great moral stature, having on every hand six 
fingers to fight with, if haply he may give the flesh of 
poets to the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field ; 
there is M. Louis Etienne, who lately laid lance in rest 
against me unoffending in championship of the upper 
powers. Since the time of Goliath it has been a holy 
liabit and tradition with the Philistines to curse " by their 
gods" — ^which indeed seems the chief utility of those 
divine beings. 

The comparative culture and relative urbanity of

responsible criticism— qualities due to no prescription of 
academic authority, but in part to natural sense and selfrespect, in part to the code of habitual honour which 
rather impels than compels a man to avow his words and 
his works — these qualities, which preserve from mere 
contempt even the Philistines of French literature when 
we turn from them to their English fellow-soldiers, have I 
suspect blinded Mr. Arnold to the real coloxurs under which 
they also serve. As yet however they have not made a 
prey of him ; Delilah has merely woven the seven locks 
of the champion's head with the web and fastened it with 
the pin ; he has but to awake out of his sleep and go away 
with the pin of the beam and with the web. But next 
time he goes to Gaza and sees there the Academy he 
must beware of going in imto that siren, or in the morning 
he may find the gates too heavy to carry off. We may 
trust indeed never to find him there eyeless at the mill 
with slaves; but it is no good sign that he should ever be 
blind of this eye or deaf of that ear— blind to infirmities 
on this side, or deaf to harmonies on that I write not 
as a disciple of the dishevelled school, " romantique h 
tous crins; " all such false and foolish catchwords as the 
names of classic and romantic I repudiate as senseless, 
and revere form or harmony as the high one law of all art. 
It is because, both as poet and critic, Mr. Arnold has 
done the service he has in the front rank of an army 
which finds among us few enough of able recruits, that I 
grudge in him the least appearance of praise or dispraise 
unworthy of his rank and office. Otherwise he would be 
as welcome for me as another Englishman to deny the 
power and variety, the supple sweetness and the superb resources of French verse in its depths and heights of song; 



MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. i8x 

as welcome to ignore the higher and enhance the mino. 
merits of a foreign literature; to mistake for the causes th 
effects of these minor merits, which in their turn become 
(as in this case of the Academy) causes of grave error 
and defect, weakening where they should strengthen the 
hands and eyes they have in training. But in a child and 
champion of the light the least obliquity or obscurity of 
vision is to be noted as dangerous. If to any one these 
seem things of minor moment, to a poet such as he is 
they cannot ; to him they must be more serious than to 
another. We owe him too much to keep silence here, 
though we might allow as harmless such graceful errors of 
pastime or paradox as the faith in Oxford which will not 
allow that she has ever " given herself to the Philistines; " 
the beauty of the valley of Sorek has surely blinded him 
to the nation and nature of the Gazites and Ascalonites 
who have dwelt there now and again as surely as have 
many of their betters. Both here and in the Academy 
there may be a profession, a tradition of culture, of sweetness, urbanity, loyalty to the light ; but where, we may 
too often have had to ask, are the things themselves? 
By their fruits ye shall know them ; and what are these ? 
In them both, if not of them, there may be good men 
and great; have such been always their leaders? or were 
ever such their types ? 

" Not here, O Apollo ! 

Are haunts meet for thee ; 
But where Helicon breaks down 
In cliff to the sea." 

There, and not in the academies or the market-places of 
the Philistines, for peace or war ; there, where all airs are 
full of the breath and all fields of the feet of the gods ; 



i82 MATTHEW ARNOLD'S NEW POEMS. 

where the sea-wind that first waved the wet hair of Venus 
moves now only the ripples that remember her rising 
*■—'■-; where the Muses are, and their mother. There 
place, who in such a place long since found Circe 
ag and heard Apollo play ; there, below the upper 
and wellsprings of the Centaurs, above the scooped 
lelves and flushing sands of the Sirens. Whatever 
le say or do, he has been and will remain to us a 
and a giver of light; unwittingly, by impulse, for 
love of it ; and such lead further and lighten otherihan they know. All consdous help or guidance 
> us less than unconsdous leadership. In his best 
i there is often a craft and a charm ; but in his best 
there is always rest, and air, and a high relief; it 
es, enlarges, refreshes with its cool ftill breath and 
!ty. On some men's nerves the temperature Strikes 
vhat cold ; there are lungs that cannot breathe but 
air of a hothouse or a hospital. There is not much 
d of heat or flame in the Vestal or lunar light that 
i from this hearth ; but it does not bum down. His 
f is a pure temple, a white flower of marble, uni without by intricate and grotesque traceries, un- 
I within by fimies of shaken censers or intoning of 
e choristers ; lai^e and clear and cool, with many 
;ls in it and outer courts, full of quiet and of music 
; pl^nest air played here there is a sound of sincerity 
kill ; as in one little Seguiaeaty which without show 
auty or any thought or fancy leaves long upon the

imagination ; pathos and passion and aspiration and desire 
are not the only springs we seek for song. Sorrows and 
joys of thought or sense meet us here in white raiment 
and wearing maiden crowns. In each court or chapel 
there is a fresh fragrance of early mountain flowers which 
bring with them the wind and the sim and a sense of 
space and growth, all of them bom in high places, washed 
and waved by upper airs and rains. Into each alike there 
fells on us as we turn a conscience of calm beauty, of cool 
and noble repose, of majestic work imder melodious and 
lofty laws ; we feel and accept the quiet sovereignties of 
happy harmony and loyal form, whose service for the 
artist is perfect freedom : it is good for us to be here. 
Nor are all these either of modem structure or of Greek ; 
here is an Asiatic court, a Scandinavian there. And 
everywhere is the one ruling and royal quality of classic 
work, an assured and equal excellence of touch. Whether 
for Balder dead and the weeping gods in Asgard, or for 
the thought-sick heart-sore king of a weary land far east, 
blinded and vexed in spirit with the piteous pains and 
wrongs of other men, the same good care and wise charm 
of right words are used to give speed of wing and sureness 
of foot to the ministering verse. The stormy northern 
world of water and air and iron and snow, the mystic oppression of eastern light and cmel colour in fiery continents 
and cities full of sickness and splendour and troubled 
tyrannies, alike yield up to him their spirit and their secret, 
to be rendered again in just and full expression. These 
are the trophies of his work and the gifts of his hand ; 
through these and such as these things, his high and distinct 
seat is assured to him among English poets.

strength, the clear light and harmony of noon unclouded 
by the night at hand. 

I take at random a few of the disputed or disputable 
passages in the text of Shelley, keeping before me the 
comments (issued in NoUs atid Queries and elsewhere) of 
Mr. Gamett, Mr. Palgrave, Mr. Rossetti, and others. 
In March and April 1868, the critic last named put forth 
a series of short papers on proposed or required emendations of passages evidendy or apparentiy defective or 
comipL The first is that crucial verse in the famous 
"Stanzas written in dejection near Naples — ^*' 

** The breath of the moist air is light." 

Another reading is "earth" for "air;" which at first 

sight may seem better, though the " unexpanded buds " 

in the next line might be called things of air as well as of 

earth, without more of literal laxity or inaccuracy than 

Shelley allows himself elsewhere. As to the question 

whether "light" (adjective) be legitimate as a rhyme to 

"light" (substantive), it may be at once dismissed. 

The license, if license it be, of perfection in the echo 

of a rhyme is forbidden only, and wrongly, by English 

critics. The emendation " slight " for " light " is absurd. 

In tlie eighteenth stanza of the first part of the 

"Sensitive Plant" there is a line impossible to reduce 

to rule, but not obscure in its bearing. The plant, which 

could not prove by produce of any blossom the love it 

felt, received more of the light and odour mutually shed 

upon each other by its neighbour flowers than did any 

one among these, and thus, though powerless to show it, 

yet

•* Loved more than ever, 
"Where none wanted but ft, could belong to the giver : " 

in other words, felt more love than the flower which gave 
it gifts of light and odour could feel, having nothing to 
give back, as the others had, in return; all the more 
thankful and loving for the very barrenness and impotence 
of requital which made the gift a charity instead of an exchange. This license of implication, this inaccuracy of 
structure, which would include or involve a noun in its 
, cognate verb (the words " loved more " being used as exactly equivalent to the words "felt more love"), it 
certainly not imitable by others, even if defensible in 
Shelley ; but the change proposed in punctuation and 
construction makes the passage dissonant and tortuous, 
throws the sense out of keeping and the sound out of 
tune. 

In the eighth stanza of the third part the foUowing 
line seems to me right as it stands — 

** Leaf after lea^ day by day — " 

if the weight and fall of the sound be properly given. 
Mr. Rossetti would slip in the word " and ; " were it there, 
I should rather wish to excise it 

In the twenty-second stanza of the " Adonais " I may 
remark that in Shelley's own Pisan edition the reading of 
the fourth line runs as it should, thus — 

** A wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs." 

I do not understand wherein can be the objection to the 
" magic mantles " of the thirteaitJl stanza. It is the best 
word, the word most wanted to convey, by one such

Hght and great touch as only a great workman can give, 
the real office and rank of the divine "shepherds," to distinguish Apollo from the run of Admetus's herdsmen. 
The reading " tragic " would be by comparison insignificant, even were there any ground of proof or likelihood 
to sustain it. In the fourth stanza of this poem SheUey 
calls Milton " the third among the sons of light" It 
has been asked who were the two first : it has been objected that there were at least three — Homer, Dante, 
Shakespeare. I should be slow to doubt that Shelley had 
in view the first and the last names only. To him Dante 
could scarcely have seemed a type of spiritual illumination, 
a son of light elect above other poets ; of this we might be 
sure without the evidence we have. No man, not even 
Landor, has laid upon the shrine of Dante a thankoffering of more delicate and passionate praise, has set a 
deeper brand of abhorrence upon the religion which 
stained his genius. Compare the twenty-second of 
^lelley's collected letters with the "Pentameron" of 
Landor — ^who has surely said enough, and said it with 
all the matchless force and charm of his most pure and 
perfect eloquence, in honour of Dante, to weigh against 
the bitterness of his blame. Had I the right or the 
strength to defend the name of one great man firom* 
the charge of another, to vindicate with all reverence the 
&me of Landor even against the verdict of Mazzini, I 
would appeal to all fellow-students whether Landor has 
indeed spoken as one '^ infirm in mind ^ or tainted with

name on record, in the very work which taxes him with 
the infection of a ferocity caught from contact with the 
plague-sores of religion. It is now hoped and suggested 
that a spirit and a sense wholly unlike their outer habit 
may underlie the written words of Dante and of Milton.^ 
That may be ; but the outer habit remains, the most 
hateful creed in all history ; uglier than the ^th of 
Moloch or of Kali, by the hideous mansuetude, the 
devilish loving- kindness of its elections and damnations. 
Herein perhaps only do these two great poets fell below 
the greater, below Homer and iEschylus, Sophocles and 
Shakespeare ; the very skirts of whose thought, the very 
hems of whose garments, are clean from the pollution of 
this pestilence. Their words as well as their meanings, 
their sound not less than their sense, we can accept as wise 
and sweet, fruitful and fresh to all time ; but the others 
have assumed the accent with the raiment of Dominic and 
Calvin — mighty men too, it may be, after their kind, but 
surely rather sons of fire than sons of light At the same 
time it may be plausibly if not reasonably allied that 
Shelley and Landor were both in some measiure disqualified by their exquisite Hellenism of spirit to relish duly 
the tone and savour of Dante's imagination. 

There are at least two passages in the " Ode to Liberty" 

' Of the poet of the English commonwealth Shelley has elsewhere said, ** The sacred Milton was, let it ever be remembered, a 
republican, and a bold inquirer into morals and religion ; " a passage 
which may serve as comment on this of the '' Adonais." On the 
other hand, Shelley in the " Defence of Poetry" does certainly 
place Dante, "the second epic poet," between Homer and Milton ; 
and so far he would seem to be referred to here also as segond 
''among the sons of light." But where then is Shakespeare^ who 
surely had the most ** light " in him of all ?

where either the meaning or the reading is dubious and 
debateable. In the thirteenth stanza, having described, 
under the splendid symbol of a summons sent from 
Vesuvius to Etna across the volcanic islets of Stromboli 
(the " iEolian isles " of old), how Spain calls England, by 
example of revolution, to rivalry of resurrection (in 1820, 
be it observed), the poet bids the two nations, " twins of 
a single destiny," appeal to the years to come. So far 
all is plain sailing. Then we run upon what seems a 
sudden shoal or hidden reef. What does this mean? 

'* Impress us from a seal. 
All ye have thought and done ! Time cannot dare conceal." 

The construction is at once loose and intricate; the 
sent^ce indeed limps on both feet ; but I am not sure ^ 
that here is not rather oversight than corruption. The 
sense at starting is clearly — "Impress us with all ye 
have thought or done, which time cannot dare conceal ; ** 
or, " Let all ye have thought and done impress us," and 
so forth. The construction runs wild and falls to pieces ; 
we found and we must leave it patchwork ; for no violence 
of alteration, were such permissible, could force it into 
coherence. When Shelley's grammar slips or trips, as it 
seems to do at times, the fault is a fault of hasty laxity, 
not of ignorance, of error, of defective sense or taste such 
as Byron's ; venial at worst, not mortal 

We start our next question in the fifteenth stanza. 
Whose or what is " the impious name " so long and so 
closely veiled imder the discreet and suggestive decency 
of asterisks? It was at once assumed and alleged to be 
the name of which Shelley had already said, through the 



I90 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

Kps of Prometheus, that " it had become a curse : *' the 
name of Christ* I for one could hardly bring myself to 
doubt that the reviewer of the moment had read ari^t. 
No other word indeed will give so adequate a sense, fit in 
so fairly with the context It should surely be a creed, a 
form of faith, upon which the writer here sets his foot. 
What otherwise shall we take to be " the snaky knot of 
this foul gordian word " — a word which, " weak itself as 
stubble," serves yet the ttun of tyrants to bind together the 
rods and axes of their rule ? If this does not mean a faith 
of some kind, and a living faith to this day, then it would 
seem at first sight that words have no meaning — ^that the 
whole divine fabric of that intense and majestic stanza 
crumbles into sparkling dust, dissolves into sonorous 
jargon. Any such vaguer substitute as " priest " or " king " 

• When this passage was written I was of course not ignorant 
that in an extant manuscript of this poem Shelley had himself filled 
up the gap with the word "king;** but this certainly did not 
appear to me a sufficient assurance that such could have been the 
original reading, aware as I was of the excisions and alterations to 
which Shelley ^^'as compelled by stress of friends or publishers to 
submit his yet unpublished or half-published poems. I am now, 
however, all but convinced that the antithesis intended was between 
the "king" of this stanza and the "priest" of the next; though 
I still think that the force and significance of the phrase are grievously 
impaired if we are to assume that the ** foul gordian word " is 
simply the title of king, and not (as so much of the context would 
appear to imply) a creed or sjrstem of religion which might at the 
time have appeared to the writer wholly or mainly pernicious. And 
this, with aU his reverence for the divine humanity of Christ, we 
know that the creed of historical Christianity did always appiear to 
Shelley. In this adoration of the personal Jesus, combined as it 
was with an equal abhorrence of Christian theology, it is now perhaps 
superfluous to remark how thoroughly Shelley was at one with 
Blake • the only poet or thinker then alive with whom he had so 
much in common.

weakens not one verse only, but makes the rest comparatively feeble and pointless, even if it can be said to leave 
them any meaning at all ; and why any such word should 
be strack out upon revision of the text by any fool or coward 
who might so dare, none surely can guess ; for such words 
recrn- at every turn as terms of reproach. Then com^s 
the question whether Shelley in 1820 would have used 
so bitter and violent a phrase to express his horror and 
hatred of the evil wrought in the world by the working 
of the Christian religion. It may help us to decide if we 
take into account with how terrible and memorable a 
name he had already branded it in the eighth stanza of 
this very poem. That he did to the last regard it as by 
all historical evidence the invariable accomplice of 
tyranny — ^as at once the constant shield and the ready 
spear of force and of fraud — his latest letters show as 
dearly as that he did no injustice to " the sublime human 
character " of its founder. The word " Christ," if received 
as the tiue reading, would stand merely as equivalent to 
the word " Christianity ; '* the blow aimed at the creed 
would imply nothing of insult or outrage to the person. 
Next year indeed Shelley \\Tote that famous chorus in the 
** Hellas " which hails the rising of " the folding star of 
Bethlehem," as with angelic salutation, in sweeter and 
more splendid words than ever fell from any Christian 
lyrist But when that chorus was written Shelley had not 
changed or softened his views of history and theology. 
His defence of Grecian cross against Turkish crescent did 
not imply that he took for a symbol of liberty the ensign 
of the Christian faith, the banner of Constantine and of 
Torquemada, under which had fought and conquered such

recruits, and with such arms, as the " paramour " * of 
Dante's Church, who begot on the body of that bride no 
less hopeful and helpful an offspring than the Holy Inquisition. Such workings of the creed, such developments 
of the faith, were before Shelley's eyes when he wrote ; he 
had also about him the reek of as foul an incense going 
up from the priests of that day to their Ferdinand or their 
George as those of ours have ever sent up to Bonaparte 
or to Boiu-bon of their own, mixing with the smell of battlesmoke and blood the more fetid fumes of prayer and praise; 
and wide as is the gap between his first and his last manner, great as is the leap from " Queen Mab " to " Hellas/* 
the passage of five years had not transformed or worn out 
the " philanthropist, democrat, and atheist " of 1816. For 
thus he signed himself in the Swiss album, not merely as 
adeoc ; and the cause or provocation is clear enough ; for 
on the same leaf there appears just above his signature an 
entry by some one who saw fit here to give vent to an 
outbreak of overflowing foolery, flagrant and fervid with 
the godly grease and rancid religion of a conventicle ; 
some folly about the Alps, God, glory, beneficence, 
witness of nature to this or that divine thing or person, 
and such-like matter. A litde below is the name of 
Shelley, with this verse attached : — 

I copy the spelling with all due regret and horror, but 
not without rejoicing on his account that Shelley was 
clear of Eton when he committed this verse, and had

now for critic or commentator a Gifford only in place of 
a Keate.^ The remarks on this entry added by Christian 
pilgrims who came afler are, in the phrase of the archetypal 
Pecksnid*, "very soothing." One of these, I think, 
observes, with a pleasant pimgency of originality, that

Most of the emendations or solutions offered by Mr. 
Rossetti of corrupt or obscure passages in the " Revolt of 
Islam " seem to me probable and sound ; but in this 
verse-*

Which might not be withstood " — 

I take the verb to be used in the absolute not the active 
sense — " bore onward or forward ; " this use of the word 
here is a somewhat ungraceful sign of haste, but makes 
dear a passage otherwise impracticably dense and chaotic. 
Before passing from this poem, I have to express a hope 
that a final edition of Shelley's works will some day, rather 
sooner than later, restore to it the proper title and the 
genuine text Every change made in it was forced upon 
the author by pressure from without ; and every change is 
for the worse. Has no reader ever asked himself what can 
be the meaning of the second title ? What is the revolt 
of Islam? Islam is not put forward as the sole creed of 

' A reference to the Eton Lists has shown me the truth of what I 
had long suspected, that the school-days of Shelley must have ended 
before the b^[inning of Dr. Keate's reign as Head Master. In 
effect, I find that Shelley, then a fifth form boy, left in 1808, and 
that the Head Mastership of Dr. Keate began in 1809. The jocularities, therefore, of Mr. Hogg as to the mutual relations of 
Shelky and the '* Old Boy " prove to be like most of his other jests 
— as baseless as they are pointless.

the tyrants and slaves who play their parts here with such 
frank ferocity ; Persian and Indian, Christian and Mahometan m3rthologies are massed together for attack. 
And certainly Islam is not, as the rules of language 
would imply, the creed of the insurgents.* Could the 
phrase ** revolt of the Christians " be taken to signify a 
revolt against the Christians ? There is at least meaning 
in the first title — " Laon and Cythna, or the Revolution 
of the Golden City." Readers may prefer a text which 
makes hero and heroine strangers in blood, but the feet 
remains that Shelley saw fit to make them brother and 
sister, and to defend their union as essentially innocent 
€ven if socially condemnable. The letters printed in the 
** Shelley Memorials " show with what staunch resolution 
he climg to this point, when beaten upon by remonstrance 
from all sides. This most singular of his social and 
ethical heresies was indeed never quite thrown over. 
^* Incest,'* he wrote in 1819 to Mrs. Gisbome, with 
reference to Calderon's tragic treatment of the story of 
Anmon and Tamar, " is, like many other incorrect things, 
a very poetical circumstance. It may be the excess of 
love or hate. It may be the defiance of everjrthing for 
the sake of another, which clothes itself in the glory of the 
highest heroism ; or it may be that cynical rage which, 

' It may be objected that the creed from which the insurgent 
population has been delivered by the preaching of Laon and Cythna 
was that of Islam, and that the word is here used to express not 
the doctrine itself, but the mass of men or nations reared in the 
belief or tradition of that doctrine. This use may doubtless be permissible, and does afford a reasonable sense to the later title of the 
poem ; but the original title as well as the original text still seems 
to me preferable.

confounding the good and bad in existing opinions, 
breaks through them for the purpose of rioting in selfishness and antipathy ; " the one he had painted in " Laon 
and Cythna," the other in the " Cenci." And in that 
absurd abortion of a book which would discredit any 
man's boyhood, not to speak of Shelle/s — " St. Irvyne, 
or the Rosicrucian" — the unfledged and half-hatched bird 
of paradise had uttered a weak note to the same tune. 
The only thing our memory carries away after that 
rabbish has been handled and sifted is the proof given in 
one passage that Shelley felt thus early some attraction to 
this subject; which is indeed suggestive and fruitful 
enough of possible tragic effect It is noticeable that he 
has never cited or referred to the magnificent masterpiece 
of Ford's genius. Those who please may deplore or may 
applaud this proclivity ; but the student must at any rate 
accept and take account of it, for the influence permeates 
much of Shelley's verse with a thin but clear undercurrent of feeling and allusion. The rarity of the cancelled edition of " Laon and Cythna " has been exaggerated by fraudulent or ignorant assertions. Besides my 
own copy, I have known of others enough at least to refute 
the fiction that there are but three in the world. I give 
but one proof among many of the injury done to the poem 
by minor changes of reading. In the thirtieth stanza of 
the twelfth canto we now read, 

"Therefore ye shall behold 
How those who love, yet fear not, dare to die ; " 

where the languid tautology of this verse impairs the 

force of a noble passage ; the genuine reading is this : 

o 2 



X 



196 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLE K 

" Therefore ye shall behold 
How Atheists and Republicans can die." ' 

Such throughout was the process by which the moreoutspoken verses of a poem outspoken enough throughout were weakened and disfigured. Remembering by 
what forcible extortion of assent a reluctant admission oF 
these changes was wrung from the poet, we must hope 
now to have back his own fresher and clearer words in 
their first fullness and freedom. 

The passage cited from "Alastor" is, I believe^ 
corrupt, but I cannot accept the critic's proposed change 
of punctuation. Here are the words disputed : — 

** On every side now rose 
Rocks which in unimaginable forms 
Lifted their black and barren pinnacles 
In the light of evening, and its precipice 
Obscuring the ravine disclosed above 
'Mid toppling stones, black gulfe, and yawning streams, ** &c 

Mr. Rossetti in evident desperation would rearrange the 
last lines thus : — 

" And — its precipice 
Obscuring — the ravine disclosed above," &c. 

" LeP (he adds), " the rocks, obscuring thfe precipice (the 
precipitous descent) of the ravine, disclosed said ravine 
overhead." 

This I must say is intolerable, and impossible. If the 
words could be wrenched and racked into such a meanings 

' This reading among others has been restored by Mr. Rossetti 
in the only critical edition of Shelley which has yet been given to 
the world ; and the gain in every such instance is so manifest that 
we are more than ever impelled to demand a full and final restoration 
of the complete and uncorrupted text as it came from the hands of 
the author.

ve should have here from one of the mightiest masters of 
language the most monstrous example on record of verbal 
deformity, of distorted and convulsed inversion or perversion of words. I suspect the word " its " to be wrong, 
and either a blind slip of the pen or a printer's error. If 
it is not, and we are to assume that there is any break in 
the sentence, the parenthesis must surely extend thus far — 
"its precipice obscuring the ravine" — />., the rocks 
opened or " disclosed " where the precipice above the 
ravine obscured it But I take " disclosed " to be the 
participle ; " its precipice darkened the ravine (which was) 
disclosed above." Then the sentence is left hanging loose 
and ragged, short by a line at least, and never wound up 
to any end at all Such a sentence we too certainly find 
once at least in the " Prometheus Unbound " (II. 4) : — 

" Who made that sense which, when the winds of spring 
In rarest visitation, or the voice 
Of one beloved heard in youth alone, 

(A line wanHttg) 
Fills the faint eyes with falling tears? " &c. 

It is waste of time to attempt any patching or furbishing of this passage by excision or substitution. Perhaps 
the author never observed what a gap was left in sense and 
grammar. As it is, we can only note the omission or 
oversight and pass on ; unless we should please or dare 
to slip in by way of complement some verse of our own 
devising ; which happily no one has done or is like to do. 

The " Prometheus Unbound " has this among other 
and better things in common with its .^Eschylean models, 
that we want now and then a scholiast for interpreter, 
having at times to read it as we might read for instance

the " Suppliants," and lacking a critic to " cure the halt 

and maimed," as Mr. Browning says of that glorious and 

hapless poem whose godlike grace and heroic beauty so 

many readers have more or less passed over with half a 

recognition, for no fault but its misfortune. I shall touch 

but on one or two points of dispute in the text as we find 

it ; and first on this (II. 4) : — 

** Till marble grew divine, 
And mothers, gazing, drank the love men see 
Reflected in their race, behold, and perish." 

The simplest explanation here possible is, I believe, 
the right Women with child gazing on statues (say on 
the Venus of Melos) bring forth children like them — 
children whose features reflect the passion of the gaze 
and perfection of the sculptured beauty; men, seeing, 
are consumed with love; "perish" meaning simply 
" deperire ; " compare Virgil's well-worn version, " XJt 
vidi, ut perii." I do not think there is any hint of 
contrast between transient flesh and immortal marble. 

In another passage Mr. Rossetti, with the touch of 
true and keen criticism, has given us at least a reasonable 
reading in place of one barely explicable. As the text has 
hitherto stood, Prometheus says to the Earth-Spirit (I. i), 

" I only know that thou art moving near 
And love. How cursed I him ? " 

This I always assumed to mean merely — " That thou art 
moving near, and dost love (me)," finding elsewhere 
such laxities of remiss writing or printing as that of 
" love " for " lovest ; " * nor am I now sure that this was

mark against Milton*s use of "empowered** for "*'cmpoweredst,**

not meant, for the " scorn " of Earth and her sons for 
Prometheus, of which he has lately complained, is not 
even in his eyes real ; he says only that to refuse his request looks as though they scorned their saviour. But 
this new reading shows keen critical power and a quickeyed ingenuity ; 

" And ycve^^haw cursed I him ?" 

though it may be objected that the sentence preceding 
comes to an abrupt and feeble close with the close of the 
verse ; and this I think is conclusive proof that the suggestion, however ingenious, must be decisively rejected. 
No conjectural emendation of a great poet's text is admissible which corrects a loose or faulty phrase by the 
substitution of one more accurate, but also more feeble 
and prosaic. AVhen in the same act the Furies are described as 

" Blackening the air of night with countless wings, 
And hollow underneath like death," 

the critic would take the word " hollow " as an epithet of 

"cast" for "castedst," he adds, "I find the same fault, where I 
am as much surprised to find it, in Shelley : 

* Thou lovest, but ne*er ktuw love's sad satiety.' " 

While at work on the text of Milton, he has given us a rule which 
all editors and commentators would be wise to lay to heart in 
Shelley's case: **It is safer and more reverential to correct the 
punctuation of a great poet than his slightest word." Mr. Palgrave's 
proposal of ** sea-girt " for ** sun-girt city " (*' Lines written among 
the Euganean Hills ") may look plausible, but the new epithet is 
feeble, inadequate, inaccurate. Venice is not a sea-girt city ; it is 
interlaced and intem'oven with sea, but not girdled ; pierced through 
with water, but not ringed about Seen by noon from the Euganean 
heights, clothed as with the very and visible glory of Italy, it might 
seem to Shelley a city girdled with the sunlight, as some Nereid 
with the arms of the sun-god. 



200 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

the wings, " with wings countless and hollow ; ** wrongly, 
as I think. These Furies of Shelley are " phantasms," 
hollow and shadowy emanations of ''the all-miscreadve 
brain : " quadam simulacra modis pallentia miris. 

The difficult passage at the end of the third act I can 
only explain by some such paraphrase as this : " the 
thrones, altars, and prisons of the past were now like those 
barbaric and monumental figures carved or engraved on 
obelisks, which survive the decay of later structures 
raised by their conquerors, tombs and prisons built by 
kings of a dynasty more recent than the race which had 
reared them\ these they see mouldering round them, 
built since their date in honour of the religion and the 
pride of past kings and priests, and are themselves now 
merely looked on as wonders;" thus only, and awkwardly, can I make anything of the involved and longdrawn sentence, unless with Mr. Rossetti we put a full 
period after the words "mouldering round," and start 
afresh in this fashion; "those monuments imaged (/.^, 
did image ; but I take imaged to be the participle) a dark 
faith, to the satisfaction and pride of kings and priests . . . 
and are now but an astonishment" This again seems to 
me inadmissible : I fear the passage must be left more or 
less in confusion, the parenthesis being so long between 
the two main verbs which prop the sentence (" which look 
forth . . . and are now," &a) ; but in fact these laige and 
stately structures of massive and majestic verse do seem 
too often to need more help of damps and girders, if the 
main stones and joists of the fabric are to hold together. 

At the close of that transcendant interlude of antiphonal music in the fourth act, the Earth takes up and 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 2or 

gives back the last notes of the Moon's chant before resuming a graver and deeper strain-: 

(** When the sunset sleeps 
Upon its snow. 

The Earth. 

And the weak day weeps 
That it should be so.") 

Mr. Rossetti would add these two last short lines to the 
song of the Moon, and make the Earth's part begin at 
the words " O gentle Moon, the voice of thy delight," 
&c : to me there has always seemed to be a sweet and 
subtle miracle of music in the text as it stands \ but how 
much of this effect may be the mere impression of habit 
and fency, the mere fruit of the fondness of years for 
these verses as I have always known them, I cannot of 
course judge ; though of course, too, I incline to take 
the verdict of my own delight in them.* 

It may be worth notice that the earliest editions of 
Shelley's poems are sometimes accurate in small points 
li^ere all others have gone wrong ; for example, the first 
fine of the speech closing the "Prometheus" runs 
rightly thus in the first edition : — 

** This is the day, which down the void abysm," 

while fix)m every later copy in the collected works the 

' Here again I must make some partial recantation of the 
judgment given in my text. Exquisite as would be the echo of the 
parting song of the Moon given back by the deeper tone of the 
music of the Earth, I think now that the fantastic beauty of that 
angle repercussive note would perhaps be out of tune with the 
supreme and equable harmony of the whole ; and there seems full 
reason to attribute this probable misprint to a misreading of the interpolation of these two lines in the manuscript of Shelley. 



202 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

word " is " has dropped off. So in the " Cenci " (II. i) 
the Livomese edition of 1 819 reads : — 

" Then *t was I whose inarticulate words 
Fell from my lips, and who with tottering steps 
Fled from your presence," &c. 

The later copies drop the word and, thus breaking down 
the metre. But this genuine edition reads (IV. 4) with 
the later text — 

" Guilty ! who dares talk of guilt ? My lord," &c., 

giving no authority for the insertion of "to" before 
" talk," which indeed rather weakens the force of emphasis in this sudden outbreak of passionate protest 
But in the speech of Marzio (V. 2) it again brings us 

right : — 

"Oh, dart 
The terrible resentment of those eyes 
On the dead earth ! " 

In the " Works " we find dread printed in place of dead^ 

which Mr. Rossetti knew by instinct for the right reading. 

Again, at the end of the third act, Shelle/s Italian edition 

runs thus : — 

** Orsino. 

When next we meet — 

GlACOMO. 

May all be done— and all 
Forgotten ; Oh, that I had never been ! " 

Siurely a better than the current version— 

"Orsino. 
When next we meet may all be done ! 

GlACOMO. 

And all 
Forgotten," &c. 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 20J 
The first English edition alone reads (I. i)— 

'* Respited me from hell ! So may the devil," &c. 

All Others, firom the Livomese onward, have let fall the 
word me. These slight things, so tedious to dwell upon^ 
all help us — and they only can help us — towards a true 
text of oiur greatest modem poet In the case of iEschylus 
or of Shakespeare, such light crumbs and dry husks would 
be held precious as grains of gold. I have but a few 
more to glean and reserve or reject as they seem worth. 

I would certainly not agree to alter without authority 
that admirable verse in the fragment on Leonardo's 
" Medusa ; " 

** Below, far lands are seen tremblingly ; " 

the intense effect of sound and accent is too rare a thing 
to lose or change. To shift the stress of a verse and 
elongate an elided syllable must prove either a triumph of 
musical instinct or a dissonant and hateful failiure. Here 
the triumphant skill and subtle sense of Shelley's ear for 
metre give special charm to the delicate daring of his 
verse, which would be lost were we to read " the far 
lands," even did this not make the line otherwise immetricaL In some other cases cited by Mr. Rossetti 
there may be room and reason for cutting out or slipping 
in a syllable or so. His corrections of text in the imperfect "Trimnph of Life" seem to me worthy of all 
giatefid acceptance : but the suggestion of '^mouthless " 
for "monthless," in the fragment of a stanza rejected from 
the " Adonais," is somewhat grotesque. " Time's monthless torrent," if these were indeed Shelley's deliberate 
words, must mean the eternal course of time without end

or beginning, which passes without taking account as we 
do of years or months, days or hours. The last stanza of 
the '^ Medusa " is a mere sketch, not ripe for criticism or 
correction ; so is the fragment of a dirge — " Rough wind, 
that moanest loud." 

In the second line of the ninety-seventh stanza of the 
translated " Hymn to Mercury," 

'* Thus King Apollo loved the child of May 
In trath, and Jove covered them with love and joy," 

for " covered " we ought evidently to read " clothed." 

In the translation of the '' Cyclops," the semichorus 
{v. 495-502 of the Greek text) is confused and inaccujate as we now read it, and the change of '^ those " and 
" there " into " thou " is in each case a clear gain as far 
as the English text is concerned, though it brings us no 
nearer to the Greek ; which runs literally thus : — 

" Happy he who shouts his song 
To the grape's dear fountain-springs, 
For a revel laid along, 
Qose in arms a loved man grasping, 
And on spread couch-coverings 
Some soft woman-blossom clasping, 
Sleek, with love-locks oiled all o'er, 
IVko^ he cries, will open me her door f^^ 

Shelley, working from an imcorrected text, has taken 
lavB6y (the old reading for &vQo^ or coXXoc) as adjective 
to fiooTpvx^yy and has washed off from the woman's hair 
the sweet oil poured over the man's curls. His version,

ing of the semichorus antiphonal to this ; when Ulysses,, 
hailed by the Cyclops, follows him out with the wine-skin, 
and the Chorus, secretly reassured and slily hopeful, sings, 
to this ambiguous effect : — 

** Fair, with feir looks prosperous, 
Comes he from the halls inside ; 
One good friend is friends with us. 
For thy body fair the lamp 
Waits alight — come, tender bride — 
In the caverns dewy-damp : 
And thine head shall soon be bound 
Not with single-coloured garlands round." 

I translate from Dindorfs text; that given by Mr. 
Paley might run thus in English :-* 

" There awaits thy flesh a lamp 
Of fierce fire, no tender bride," &c. 

The " lamp " would then be, of course, the firebrand 
prepared to blind Polyphemus, and the two last lines, in 
the words of the editor (vol. iii. p. 509), " mean that in 
the place of a crown of myrtle and roses a ring of gory 
hue shall encircle his brows." In either c^e I suppose 
the ironic allusions to the torch of marriage and the 
marriage-wreath of divers colours must be the same. 

There is no gap in the translation at v. 675, and the 
asterisks inserted after the words " Nowhere, O Cyclops,"' 
would be better away. The passage describing the 
cookery of Polyphemus (w. 390-395) is difficult and 
debateable enough, but less hard than the desperate 
version of Shelley, who in his note " confesses that he 
does not understand this." The reading ^^four amphorae,'^ 
just above, is a misprint or slip of the pen for " ten ; " the 
next few words are curiously tiunbled together and mis-

construed. Shelley has not distinguished the drinkingcan or cup (<ri:v^c) wrought of ivy-wood, or carved round 
with ivy-leaves, from the ninety-gallon bowl (icpar^p) into 
which the Cyclops had just milked his cows. Read : — 

** Then he milked the cows, 
And, pouring in the white milk, filled a bowl 
That might have held ten amphorae ; and by it 
He set himself an ivy-carven cup — 
Three cubits wide and four in depth it seemed — 
[And set a brass pot on the fire to boil] *

"And the under- jaws 
Of axes, huge JEtnssan slaughtering-tools." 

I do not see the meaning of those asterisks marking 
omission where omission is none, between the opening 
speech of Silenus and the parode. Of this Shelley has 
only translated the strophe and the latter part of the 
epode. Why the intervening verses were omitted it is 
impossible to say. In default of tlie better version he 
has begrudged us I offer this by way of makeshift, following the exact order and cadence of rhymes observed by- 
Shelley. After the call to the she-goat* (which he

be altered to "she" and "mother."

the shout is not meant to scare, but to reclaim) the song 
continues — a literal goat-song for once : —

Of your sucklings calls you home ; 
Come to fold then, will you ? come

Up in iEtna*s rock-strewn passes.

Here, nor Msenads thyrse-bearing. 
Nor glad clang of kettledrums. 
Nor by well or running spring 
Drops of pale bright wine ; nor now

An Bacchic melody 
To the golden Aphrodite

Read do for willy which stands in Shelley's text 
through mere misreading of the passage ; it was doubtless wrongly pointed in the copy by which he worked. 

There is another omission after verse 165, more 
acx:ountable than this ; whether any part of Shelley's 
vCTsion was struck out or not in the printing we have not 
been told. Perhaps the passage, essential as it is to the 
continuity of the scene, may be borne with in this 
reduced and softened form. Afler the verse — " I would 
give All that the Cyclops feed upon their mountains,"^

In this laudable frame of mind the Falstaffof Olympus 
makes off on his sheep-stealing errand ; and the Chorus,

After this discussion of Helen by the satyrs, Silenus 

returns with his plunder ; his speech begins (v. 188) " See, 

here are sheep," &c. Shelley, following the older editions, 

puts into his mouth all this last answer of the Chorus to 

Ulysses, with its exquisite satyric moralising on feminine 

levity. At the entrance of the Cyclops there is some 

misconstruction : — 

** Silenus. 

What ho ! assistance, comrades, haste, assistance ! 

Cyclops. 
What is this tumult ? " 

The line given to Silenus belongs to the Cyclops 
as he bursts in upon the stage, and might rather be 
rendered: — 

** Hold hard, let's see here, lend a hand : what's this ? 
What sloth ? what rioting ? " 

At verse 220 there is* another break; SUenus has 
said, " Anything you like, only don't drink me up ; " and 
the Cyclops, as delicate a monster as Caliban, replies : — 

" By no means, for you'd be the death of me 
Then, tumbling in my belly, with your tricks." 

At verse 345, read, to fill up the gap at the end of the 
Cyclops' speech : — 

•* So creep in quick, to stand about the shrine 
O* the god o' the cave and feast me fcurly full." 

The god of the cave is explained to be, as above, 

"Myself 
And this great belly, first of deities."

tampered rashly with the inspired* canon of scriptvure, I 
can only put forward the plea found in that former case

to clear the blotted records, which contain the divine

ventured to retranslate in full, I never designed to supplant 
the text, but merely to elucidate. These small and slow 
labours of verbal criticism are the best returns we can 
make, the best tribute we can pay to a great man's work ; 
and no man need think that a waste of his time, which 
so often employed the hours and the minds of Milton and 
of Landor. It is easier to dilate at length on the excellence of a man's genius than to sift and test it by proof 
of syllable and letter, that so the next student may at least 
find a clear and certain text to study, without the trouble 
of deciphering a faded palimpsest or refitting a broken 
puzzle. And we have especial need of accuracy and 
fullness of text when the text is Shelley's. His mark is 
burnt in more deeply and more durably upon men's minds 
than that of any among the great poets of his day. Of 
these, Coleridge and Keats set no such mark on the spirit 
of their readers ; * they left simple and perfect examples 
of work absolutely faultless, visibly imsurpassable, selfresumed and self-content. Byron was first to stamp with 
his signet the thought and feeling of one kind of men ; 
then Wordsworth in turn set his mark on a different kind. 
But the one for want of depth and sense and harmony, 
the other for want of heat and eyesight and lifeblood, 
and both for want of a truer force and a truer breadth of 
spirit, failed to impress upon all time any such abiding 
sign of their passage and their power, any such inevitable 

' Coleridge's personal influence as preacher or professor of 
ghostly dialectics and marshlight theosophy (brighter indeed than 
the bedroom rushlights about it, but no star or sun) was a thing 
distinct from his doings as a poet. There was no more direct work 
done by his mere verse than by the mere verse of Keats.

and ineffaceable mark to bear witness of their work, as 
Dante or Milton, Goethe or Shelley, each in his special 
fashion. 

It is no bad way of testing an opinion held vaguely 
but sincerely to take it up and rub it, as it were, against 
the opinion of some one else, who is clearly worth 
agreeing with or disagreeing. Mr. Arnold, with whose 
clear and critical spirit it is always good to come in contact, as disciple or as dissenter, has twice spoken of Shelley, 
each time, as I think, putting forth a brilliant error, shot 
through and spotted with glimpses of truth. Byron and 
Shelley, he says, " two members of the aristocratic class/' 
alone in their day, strove " to apply the modem spirit " to 
English literatiure. " Aristocracies are, as such, naturally 
impenetrable by ideas; but their individual members 
have a high courage and a turn for breaking bounds ; and 
a man of genius, who is the bom child of the idea, happening to be bom in the aristocratic ranks, chafes against the 
obstacles which prevent him from freely developing it" 
To the truth of this he might have cited a third witness ; 
for of the English poets then living, three only were 
children of the social or political idea, strong enough to 
breathe and work in the air of revolution, to wrestle with 
change and hold fast the new liberty, to believe at all in 
the godhead of people or peoples, in the absolute right 
and want of the world, equality of justice, of work and 
truth and life ; and these three came all out of the same 
rank, were all bom into one social sect, men of historic 
blood and name, having nothing to ask of revolution, 
nothing (as the phrase is now) to gain by freedom, but 
leave to love and serve the light for the light's sake^ 



214 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

Landor, who died last, was eldest, and Shelley, who died 
first, was youngest of the three. Each stood alike apart 
from the rest, far unUke as each was to the other two ; not, 
like Coleridge, blind to the things of the time, nor, like 
Keats, practically alien to all things but art ; and leaving 
to Southey or Wordsworth the official laurels and loyalties 
of courtly content and satisfied compliance. Out of their 
rank the Georges could raise no recruits to beat the drum 
of prose or blow the bagpipes of verse in any royal and 
constitutional procession towards nuptial or funereal 
goal.* 

So far we must go with Mr. Arnold ; but I cannot 
follow him when he adds that Byron and Shelley failed in 
their attempt ; that the best " literary creation " of their 
time, work "far more solid and complete than theirs,* was 
due to men in whom the new spirit was dead or was unborn ; that, therefore, " their names will be greater than 
their writings." First, I protest against the bracketing of 
the two names. With, all reserve of reverence for the 
noble genius and memory of Byron, I can no more accept 
him as a poet equal or even akin to Shelley on any side 

* The one kindly attempt of Landor to fill Southey's place for 
him when disabled could scarcely have proved acceptable to his 
friend's official employers.

but one, than I could imagine Shelley endowed with the 
v£uious, fearless, keen-eyed, and triumphant energy which 
makes the greatest of B3n:on's works so great With all 
his glory of ardour and vigour and humour, B3n:on was a 
singer who could not sing ; Shelley outsang all poets on 
record but some two or three throughout all time ; his 
depths and heights of inner and outer music are as divine 
as natiu-e's, and not sooner exhaustible. He was alone 
the perfect singing-god ; his thoughts, words, deeds, all 
sang together. This between two singing-men is a distinction of some significance ; and must be, until the inarticulate poets and their articulate outriders have put 
down singing-men altogether as unrealities, inexpedient 
if not afflictive in the commonwealth of M. Proudhon and 
Mr. Carlyle. Till the dawn of that "most desired hour, 
more loved and lovely than all its sisters," these unblessed generations will continue to note the difference, 
and take some account of it Again, though in some 
sense a "child of the idea," Byron is but a foundling or 
bastard child ; Shelley is bom heir, and has it by birthright ; to Byron it is a charitable nurse, to Shelley a 
natural mother. All the more praise, it may be said, to 
Byron for having seen so much as he did and served so 
loyally. Be it so then; but let not his imperfect and 
intermittent service, noble and helpful now, and now 
alloyed with baser temper or broken short through sloth 
or spite or habit, be set beside the flawless work and 
perfect service of Shelley. His whole heart and mind, 
his whole soul and strength, Byron could not give to the 
idea at all ; neither to art, nor freedom, nor any faith 
whatever. His life's work therefore falls as short of the

standard of Shelley's as of Goethe's work. To compare 
** Cain *' with " Prometheus," the " Prophecy of Dante 
with the " Ode to Naples," is to compare " Manfred 
with " Faust.** Shelley was bom a son and soldier of 
light, an archangel winged and weaponed for angel's work. 
Byron, with a noble admixture of brighter and purer 
blood, had in him a cross of the true Philistine breed. 

There is no other word than this yet devised which 
will carry the exact weight of meaning wanted. The use 
of it is however, it seems, offensive to certain persons ; 
one writer has actually signed his name to an article in 
which he asserts that Mr. Matthew Arnold and I after 
him use or abuse it as a reproachful synonym for the 
name of Christian. Anonymous fiction of this kind no 
man will notice who respects the truth or himself; but 
some exposition of the meaning of words may be permissible and serviceable for the correction of an error 
or the exposure of a falsehood. It is not the correction 
of an error that is for the minute my task. This writer, 
whose article was signed with the name of Peter Bajme, 
undertakes the defence of his gods in heaven above and 
on earth beneath against Mr. Arnold and myself with 
engines and artillery of a somewhat shaky and explosive 
kind. For mvself, it appears that I, " who am refined '* 
(/^v/^Bayne) " in my language, and have quite the manners 
of a gentleman " (this I fear is the scathing expression of 
a pungent irony), have denounced the whole race of 
" Christians " at one fell swoop as " noisome Philistines ; " 
exceeding Mr. Arnold by the addition of an epithet I 
am not concerned to dispute the degrees of gentility with 
a falsifier of the sense of words, to question the breeding

or pass sentence on the manners of a public and selfexposed libeller. I would only remark that when the 
reader is led or driven off the bare highway of truth it is 
but fair to afford him some morsel of slander so spiced 
and sauced that it may perhaps slip glibly down some 
one's gullet without sticking, some palatable and digestible condiment of calumny, some pleasanter pasture, at 
least, than a twice-cooked and twice-chewed mess of 
thistles : for it cannot be certain that he will by some 
divine inborn instinct prefer that diet to any other. Mr. 
Bayne's calumnies are somewhat dry, a little flat and 
hard ; Crabtree, in this revival of Sheridan's play, moves 
clumsily in the coarse livery of slander in imdress, without 
the brocade and perfume of Backbite, the genial grace of 
Mrs. Candour, or the sinewy and flexible facility of Snake. 
His crude fiction wants breadth, delicacy, sureness of 
touch ; Tartufie would scarcely have taken him on trial

that my " years and achievements make it fitting " for me 
^^ to point t/ujinger of scorn 2X^^ figures enthroned in the 
pantheon of his moral m}'thology. What may be the 
years and what the achievements of Mr. Peter B^yne I 
know not ; but I do know that the years of Nestor and 
the achievements of Napoleon would not suffice to extenuate fatuity on the one hand and false witness on 
the other. 

A slandered man may, if he please, daim leave to 
take (though he may not care to make) occasion in 
passing to set a mark on the calumniator ; but he will 
hardly care to take into his hands the hangman's office of 
applying the iron or the lash. I have done, and return 
without apology from mean to higher matters. Of the 
relation between Shelley and Byron I have here no more 
to say ; but before ending these notes I find yet another 
point or so to touch upon. Perhaps to every student of 
any one among the greater poets there seems to be something in his work not yet recognised by other students, 
some secret power or beaut}' reserved for his research. I 
do not think that justice has yet been done to Shelley as 
to some among his peers, in all details and firom every 
side. Mr. Arnold, in my view, misconceives and misjudges him not less when set against Keats thaa when 
bracketed with Byron. Keats has indeed a divine magic 
of language applied to nature ; here he is unapproachable ; 
this is his throne, and he may bid all kings of song come 
bow to it But his ground is not Shelley's ground ; they 
do not run in the same race at all. The " Ode to Autimm," 
among other such poems of Keats, renders nature as no 
man but Keats ever could. Such poems as the " Lines

written among the Euganean Hills " cannot compete with 
it But do they compete with it ? The poem of Keats, 
Mr. Arnold says, ^^ renders Nature ; " the poem of Shelley 
^^ tries to render her." It is this that I deny. \Vhat 
Shelley tries to do he does ; and he does not try to do 
the same thing as Keats. The comparison is as empty 
and profitless as one between the sonnets of Shakespeare 
and the sonnets of Milton. Shelley never in his life wrote 
a poem of that exquisite contraction and completeness, 
within that roimd and perfect limit. This poem of the 
Euganean Hills is no piece of spiritual sculpture or 
painting after the life of natural things. I do not pretend 
to assign it a higher or a lower place; 1 say simply that 
its place is not the same. It is a rhapsody of thought and 
feeling coloured by contact with nature, but not bom of 
the contact ; and such as it is all Shelley's work is, even 
when most vague and vast in its elemental scope of 
labour and of aim. A soul as great as the world lays 
hold on the things of the world ; on all life of plants, and 
beasts, and men ; on all likeness of time, and death, and 
good things and evil. His aim is rather to render the 
effect of a thing than a thing itself ; the soul and spirit 
of life rather than the living form, the growth rather 
than the thing grown. And herein he too is unapproachable. 

Other and lesser critics than Mr. Arnold have taxed 
Shelley with a want of dramatic power upon the characters and passions of men. While writing these notes 
I have come across the way of such an one, who bids 
us notice how superior in truth and subtlety is Mr. 
Browning's study of Guido Franceschini to Shelley's of 



:22o NOTES On the text of SHELLEY. 

Count Cenci. Here again a comparison is patched up 
between two things utterly unamenable to the same rule. 
The wonderful figure so cunningly drawn and coloured 
by Mr. Browning is a model of intense and punctilious 
realism.* Every nerve of the mind is touched by the 
patient scalpel, every vein and joint of the subtle and intricate spirit divided and laid bare. A close and dumb 
soul compelled into speech by mere struggle and stress 
of things labours in literal translation and accurate agony 
at the hps of Guido. This scientific veracity which 
unbuilds and rebuilds the whole structure of spirit, 
thought by thought and touch by touch, till the final 
splendour of solution is achieved, and the consummate 
labour made perfect from key-stone to coping-stone, is so 
triiunphant a thing that on its own ground it can be 
matched by no poet ; to match it we must look back to 
Balzac* Shelley worked by other rules to another end : 
with the sculptor's touch rather than the anatomist's. 
But his figure of Cenci is not the less accurate for its 
breadth of handling. We might as well consign Manon 
Lescaut to a place below Emma Bovary, because Provost 
wrought out his immortal study with broader lines and 
fewer colours than Flaubert. A figure may be ideal and 
yet accurate, realistic and yet untrue, as a fact not 
thoroughly fathomed may be in effect a ^sehood. 
There is a far stronger cross of the ideal in the realism of 

' The word realism has a higher and a baser sense ; there is the 
grand spiritual realism of Balzac or Browning, as well as the crude 
and facile realism, or vulgarism rather, of writers wanting alike in 
spirit and in form. It is so often used as a term of reproach on one 
side, on the other as a boastful watchword, that when taken as a 
simple term of definition it may perhaps be misconstrued.

-^Eschylus or Shakespeare than runs through the work of 
the great modem realists. What was the latent breadth 
or depth of SheUey's dramatic genius we cannot say, as 
be had not time himself to know. It is incomplete in 
the " Cend ; " for example, in the figure of Orsino the 
lines are not cut sharp and deep enough ; he is drawn too 
easily and lightly ; the picture looks thin and shadowy 
beside the vivid image we get from the old report of the 
Cenci trial. That sketch of Monsignor Guerra, the tall 
delicate young priest, with long curls and courtly graces, 
plajring on crime as on a lute with fine fingers used to 
music-making, might have been thrown out in keen 
relief against the great figiure of Cenci ; a Caponsacchi 
turned ignoble instead of noble, and as weU worth 
drawing had the hand been there to draw. As it is, he 
plays but a poor part, borne up only by the sweet strength 
of Shelley's verse. But is Cenci himself the mere and 
monstrous embodiment of evil made flesh, the inrational 
and soulless mask of lust and cruelty, that critics have 
called him ? Is he in effect as inanimate and imreal as 
Guido is real and alive ? To me, putting aside the difference of handling between the schools of which 
Shakespeare and Balzac are respectively the heads, the 
one seems as true as the other. Cenci, as we see him, is 
the full-blown flower, the accomplished result of a life 
absolute in its luck, in power and success and energetic 
enjoyment. His energy is insatiable of emotions, and 
has few left to make trial of; the conscience of this 
sharpens and exasperates the temper of his will. 
Something within him, bom as much of the spirit as the

by dint of hard use is a need of his nature ; " his soul, 
which is a scourge," must needs smite to know itself alive 
and taste its strength : too strong for satiety or collapse^ 
while life endures his nature must bite and bum as surely 
as steel must or flame. AVhat he is, good fortune has 
made him — " Strength, health, and pride, and lust, and 
length of days." What Guido Franceschini is, he has 
been made by iU fortune. Fed with good things from 
his birth, the evil nature in him might have swollen into 
the likeness of Cenci's ; as Cenci, crossed and cramped at 
every turn of life, with starved energies and shrivelled 
lusts, might have shrunk into the shape of Guido, a 
pained and thwarted spirit of self-suffering evil The 
one, though drawn with less detail of growth from seed 
to fruit, is surely not less conceivable than the other; 
but Cenci's is the stronger spirit, the more solid and 
roimded nature: he was not one to struggle or foil. 
Shelley has made his ruling appetite the lust of strength, 
of self-conscious and spiritual power : he has not added 
the fleshly lust of pain and subtle animal relish of the 
pungent infliction, which was doubtless interfused with 
Cenci's sensuous cruelty. But the august and horrible 
figure is painted as naturally as nobly ; his rage and his 
religion, the loathing that underlies his lust, and the 
lust that inflames his loathing ; his hungry abhorrence of 
his daughters beauty of body and soul — (" Beast that 
thou art 1 ") — ^his faith in God and fury against good, his 
splendid exaltation of spirit into a passionate and winged 
rapture of ardent hatred or of fiery joy, consummate in 
that last outbreak as of all the fumes and flames of hell 
at once, are no more alien from nature or each other 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 223 

than Guido's subtle crossings and windings of soul through 
backstairs and b)rways of brute craft and baser pride, 
of barren anger and greed and pain. This is evidence 
enough that if Shelley had lived the " Cend " would not 
now be the one great play written in the great manner 
of Shakespeare's men that our literature has seen since 
the time of these. The proof of power is here as sure 
and as clear as in Shelley's lyric work ; he has shown 
himself, what the dramatist must needs be, as able to 
lace the light of hell as of heaven, to handle the fires of 
evil as to brighten the beauties of things. This latter work 
indeed he preferred, and wrought at it with all. the grace 
and force of thought and word which give to all his lyrics 
the light of a divine life ; but his tragic truth and excellence are as certain and absolute as the sweetness and 
the glory of his songs. The mark of his hand, the trick 
of his voice, we can always recognise in their clear character and individual cliarm ; but the range is various 
firom the starry and heavenly heights to the tender and 
flowering fields of the world wherein he is god and lord : 
with here such a flower to gather as the spinners' song of 
Beatrice, and there sucJi a heaven to ascend as the 
Prologue to Hellas, which the zealous love of Mr. 
Gamett for Shelley has opened for us to enter and 
possess for ever; v/here the pleadings of Christ and 
Satan alternate as the rising and setting of stars in the 
abyss of luminous sound and sonorous light We have 
now but to await the final gift of a perfect and critical 
edition of the whole works, the supreme tribute of love 
and worship yet owing to the master singer of our 
modem race and age ; to the poet beloved above all

and the only proper word — divine. 



Note. 

Shortly after the publication of these slight and rapid 
notes, the appearance of the edition whose advent was 
here hopefully invoked gave a fresh impulse and opened 
a wider way to the study of Shelley. The ardour and 
labour expended on his glorious task by Mr. W. M. 
Rossetti must link his name for ever in honourable 
association with that of the poet to whom he has done 
such loyal and noble service. He has lightened the 
darkness that perplexed us at so many turns of a 
labyrinth which others had done their best to darken ; he 
has delivered all students from the bondage of Medwin 
and Hogg : at those muddy springs no future " mental 
traveller " will ever need again to slake or to cheat his 
thirst for some dubious drop of information as to how 
the god of song might have appeared on earth to the 
shepherds or the swineherds of Admetus. He has done 
much more than this ; he has had the glory of giving to 
the world fresh verse of Shelley's. Whole poems and 
priceless fragments, fresh instalments of imperfect but imperishable work, we owe to the labour of his love. Often 
too he has found means to elucidate and to rectify much 
that was corrupt and obscure. For all these benefits he 
deserves all the gratitude that' can be given by lovers of 
Shelley whose love has borne no such fruit and done 
no such service as his. Outside the precincts of Grubstreet 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 225 

no dullness could ignore and no malignity deny the 
value of the service done, the greatness of the benefits 
conferred. On the other hand, I am impelled, however 
unwillingly, to enter my protest against the general prindple on which the text has been recast and rearranged. 
The very slightest change of reading, thou^ it should 
be but a change in ptmctuation, ought never to be oflfered 
without necessity, as it can never be received without 
reluctance. To throw over for some new version, though 
never so rational or plausible, the text we have by heart, the 
words which line by line and letter by letter have grown 
as it were a part of ourselves, have worked their way (so to 
speak) into the veiy lifeblood of our thought, the very 
core and conscience of our memory, cannot but be 
pain and grief to any faithful and loving student But in 
this revision, so far from showing any tenderness or 
respect for such feelings as he might have been supposed 
to share, Mr. Rossetti has too often handled SheUey, I 
will not say as Milton was handled by Bentley, but I 
must say as Shakespeare was handled by Steevens. The 
punctilious if not pedantic precision which has reformed 
the whole scheme of punctuation, doubtless often loose 
enough in the original editions, compels us to remark 
that the last state of this text is worse than the first. 
This edition is beyond praise and beyond price as a book 
of reference ; but no one, I should imagine, will ever 
read in it for pleasure, while he can procure instead the 
loosest and most incorrect of those previously printed. 
Throughout the whole five acts of the " Cenci " the reader 
is incessantly irritated by such smaU but significant 
vexations as the substitution of " you " for " thou " or 

Q 



226 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

" thee " for " you," on some rigid system of regulation to 
which the editor himself does not pretend to suppose 
that his author ever proposed to conform. Now I cannot 
but think that a lesser poet than Shelley might reasonably 
be presumed to know better than his editor what he 
meant to say, and by what rule or what instinct his hand 
was guided as he wrote. To me the tact or instinct 
which even in these small matters directed the hand and 
determined the choice of Shelley seems so nearly infallible in its exquisite and subtle delicacy, that even if 
for once my own taste would have rejected the turn of a 
sentence or a phrase which to his taste has seemed 
preferable I should undoubtedly consider that he was 
likelier to be right than I — ^at least with regard to his own 
work. Of this readjustment of the words " you " and 
^* thou " six instances are acknowledged and the principle 
of reformation is vindicated in a note; but for the 
sentences broken up and recast, the interpolated periods 
which make two or three curt inharmonious sentences 
out of one most harmoniously prolonged through natural 
pauses to its natural end — for these and other vexatious 
pedantries or petty rigidities of rule, it does not seem 
that any defence or apology has been thought needfiiL 
Yet a skilful and able student or master of language 
such as Mr. Rossetti cannot surely need io be told 
that these superfluous breaks and changes in the punctuation deform and destroy the fine perfection of the 
metre ; that the harmony of a whole speech or a whole 
stanza may be shattered by the intrusion or suppression 
of a colon or a comma ; that a false pointing in English 
verse is as bad as a false quantity in Latin. There is no 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 227 

man living, in my mind, who might be trusted to correct 
the metre of Shelley; and among all past poets of his 
own rank I know of none who might have been so 
trusted but Milton. And it is no less an enterprise than 
this that Mr. Rossetti has taken upon himself. Surely, 
too, his scholarship was somewhat at fault when he 
likened to the English of Mrs. Gamp the use of an 
obsolete and doubtless a licentious construction in 
" Rosalind and Helen" — 

** My Lionel, who, as every strain 
Grew fainter but more sweet, his mien 
Sunk—" 

here altered by the excision of the word who and the 
substitution of a period for a comma, which compels us 
t6 b^n a fresh sentence with the following words. Even 
were the original reading a mere solecism, it would be 
preferable to such drawing and quartering of a poet's 
text as this. But it is simply a revival — indefensible 
indeed in my eyes, and probably due to mere haste — of a 
lax usage i)ermitted to elder writers both in verse and 
prose. If all texts are to be regulated after this pedagogic 
fashion, neither Shakespeare nor even Milton will be 
secure against correction. The poem in which this 
passage ^occurs, certainly the least precious example we 
have of Shelley's mature work, was, as we know, resumed 
and completed at the desire of Mrs. Shelley after it had 
been cast aside as not worth completion ; and we may 
well suppose that the task was executed rapidly and with 
little of the passionate pleasure that impels and informs 
the execution of work into which the workman can put 

Q 2 



228 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY, 

his whole heart A much more real and grave solecism 
in '' Julian and Maddalo" has been left not only uncorrected but unnoticed — " One blessing which thou ne'er 
didst imprecate far on me." Even such a positive 
blunder as this I should not myself have presumed to 
correct by any process of suppression and substitution ; 
but it is singular that an editor who has never scrupled 
to apply this process when he thought fit should have 
abstained from applying it in this really flagrant instance 
of bad English. Against another example of this interference I must also protest for the sake of my own and 
all ears that have been trained on the music of Shelley ; 
I refer to the change made in the last verses of the 
overture to the "Lines ^Titten among the Euganean 
Hills." If the editor finds the Ucense of such a 
phiaseas 

" Every little living nerve 
Are like sapless leaflets now ** 

too ** annoying " to be endured by a scholastic sense of 
prc^riety, the annoyance is far keener which will be inflicted on others by his substituted reading — " Is like a 
sapless leaflet now." Here again SheUey has indulged 
in a loose and obsolete construction which may or may 
not be defensible ; I should not at the present day 
permit it to myself, or condone it in another ; and had 
the editor been engaged in the revision of a schoolboy's 
theme, he would certainly have done right to correct such 
a phrase, and as certainly would not have done wrong to 
add such further correction as he might deem desirable ; 
but the task here undertaken is not exactly comparable 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 229 

to the revision of a schoolboy's theme. Nor are these 
grammatical castigations the worst examples of the singular 
freedom with which so true and studious an enthusiast 
for the fame of Shelley has thought it allowable to handle 
the text of his greatest poems. Under the pernicious 
guidance of professors and pedagogues dead and living 
he has been induced to dismember and disfigure such 
samples of lyric verse as touch the very highest top of 
possible perfection — ^songs that might have been envied 
by Simonides and praised by Sappho. By one of these 
blind (and deaf) guides he has been led to deface two 
stanzas of the '^Skylark" after a ^hion only to be 
paralleled, I should hope, in Bentley's Milton ; to displace 
the pause in the second stanza so as at once to deform 
the meaning and destroy the music ; and in the third to 
supplant ^^zxi> unbodied** by ^^ an embodied }oy" I Even 
this is not the very worst of all. If there is one verse in 
Shelley or in English of more divine and sovereign 
sweetness than any other, it is that in the " Lament " — 

" Fresh spring, and summer, and winter hoar." 

The music of this line taken with its context — the melodious effect of its exquisite inequality * — I should have 

' If any man of human ear can want further evidence than his 
own sense of harmony in support of the true and hitherto undisputed 
reading, he may find one instance among others of the subtle and 
wonderful use to which Shelley would sometimes put a seeming 
imperfection of this kind in the verses to Emilia Viviani : 

" Is it with thy kisses or thy tears ? " 

Here the same ineffable effect of indefinable sweetness is produced 
by an exact repetition (but let no aspiring ** poet-ape " ever think 
to reproduce it by imitation) of the same simple means — the suppression, namely, of a single syllable. And I cannot but wonder as

thought was a thing to thrill the veins and draw tears tothe eyes of all men whose ears were not closed against 
all harmony by some denser and less removable obstruction than shut out the song of the Sirens from the 
hearing of the crew of Ulysses. Yet in this edition (vol. ii. 
p. 274) the word "autmnn" is actually foisted in after 
the word "summer." Upon this incredible outrage I 
really dare not trust m)rself to comment The only 
parallel I know to it within the memory of man is the 
repainting of Giotto's portrait of Dante by an Italian 
hireling at the bidding of his Austrian masters, wha 
desired to efl^ce from the poet's berretta the sacred 
national coloiu^ of hope and faith and love. That is 
irreparable ; but the outrage oflfered to the text of Shelley 
happily is not For the conception of this atrocity the 
editor is not responsible; for its adoption he is. A 
thousand years of purgatorial fire would be insufficient 
expiation for the criminal on whose deaf and desperate 
head must rest the original guilt of defacing the text of 
SheUey with this most damnable corruption. To such 
earless and soulless commentators, strong only in fingercounting and figure-casting, the ghost of their divine 
victim, whether Shakespeare or Shelley, might say with 
Paulina — 

" Do not repent these things. • • ♦

. Upon a barren mountain, and still winter 
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods 
To look that way thou wert" 

At least we may be assiired that no such penance, 
though multiplied beyond the calailation of all arithmeticians who ever made use of their science as a leadline to sound the depths of song, as a key to unlock the 
secrets of harmony, could ever move the righteous judge 
of Marsyas to look with pity on the son of Midas who 
had thus abused the text of one so dear to him as 
Shelley. The race of his old enemy, we perceive, has 
d^enerated since the date of the Phrygian king; the 
r^;al and paternal ears are indeed hereditary, but as surely 
as the touch of the father turned all things to gold, so 
surely the touch of his children turns all things to lead. 

I shall merely notice the single remaining instance 
of perversion which I feel bound not to pass over in 
silence ; the false pointing of one of the noblest passages 
in the " Prometheus Unbound " — 

" Heap on thy head, by virtue of this curse, 

HI deeds, then be thou damned, beholding good." 

I should really have thought it impossible to mistake 
the simple and obvious meaning of these and the glorious 
verses which follow; namely, that the curse invoked on 
the almighty tyrant was to do evil and behold good. 
The idea is of course not original ; few lines have been 
oftener quoted, and few have better deserved their fame, 
than the majestic verse in which Persius has invoked 
upon tyrants a deeper damnation than ever priest conceived — 

" Virtutem videant intabescantque reUctd." 



232 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY, 

What indeed, compared to this, are the gross and brutish 
threats of theological materialism? what is the ice 
or fire of Dante, the burning marl of Milton ? But by 
the application of this supreme curse to the supreme 
oppressor Shelley has transfigured the noble moral 
thought of the Stoic poet into the splendour of an idea 
too sublime for the conception of one so much lesser 
than himself. It is utterly inexplicable to me how an 
editor of Mr. Rossetti's high and rare intelligence in 
matters of art and imagination can here for once have 
failed to foUow the track of Shelley's thought, to see with 
Shelley's eyes this vision of the two infinities of good and 
evil ; of the evil deeds wrought by omnipotence and* the 
good deeds wrought by suflfering — ^both of these infinite 
as God himself, as the world he torments, as the solitude 
which is at once the condition and the chastisement of 
his omnipotence. The sequence of ideas is so natural 
and logical, so coherent with the whole scheme and 
subject of the poem, that I cannot understand by what 
strange aberration the editor should have lost his way 
through so plain and open a tract of country, and thought 
it necessary to shatter at once the harmony, .the sense, 
and the grammar of so simple and superb a passage in 
order to patch up an explanation as forced, unnatural, 
and improbable as the more obvious interpretation was 
clear, consistent, and sufficient I should add that as 
Mr. Rossetti, with his habitual candour and generous 
good sense, has since published a note which may be 
taken as equivalent to a recantation of the error which 
led him to cast aside the previous text for the dissonant 
and incongruous version produced by a change of pointing. 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 233 

I should not have given even this passing notice to the 
matter had the passage been less important, the perversion less flagrant, or the mistake already cancelled 
I have now, to adopt a pedagogic formula which might 
beseem the lips of a commentator in the heat of correction, 
discharged a painful duty, but one which I felt to be incumbent on me ; and I may add, in the same professional 
style and spirit, that I hope I may never be compelled to 
undertake it again. It should also be noted by those 
who may feel most keenly the indignity oflferedto Shelley 
by such perversions and corruptions of his meaning and 
his music as those on which I have here had to remark, 
that no little service has been done to the text in other 
places by the simple correction of many such obvious 
and indubitable misprints as deform the penultimate 
stanza of " The Revolt of Islam ; " where, to take but a 
single instance, the words " one line " had in all previous 
editions been allowed to stand in defiance of sense and 
metre, both of which for more than half a century had 
been crying aloud for the restoration of the right reading 
— " on a line." 

I have .but one other fault to find with this first 
critical edition of Shelley; and in this instance I am 
confident of having with me, I had wellnigh said all 
lovers of his fame, but that this would exclude at least 
one name which must always be counted among those of 
his most loving disciples — that of the editor himself. To 
reprint in an appendix the monstrous mass of doggrel 
which has been pitilessly preserved by the evil fidelity of 
Mr. Hogg, and to add even the metrical sweepings of 
" St Irvyne," is an oflfence on which I believe that the 



234 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

verdict of all competent critics has been unanimous. 
That this wretched rubbish should exist at all in print is 
vexation enough for those to whom the honour of the 
greatest poets is dear ; but Mr. Hogg's book is a monu* 
ment likely to prove something less durable than brass, 
and in its mouldering pages the evidence of Shelley's 
boyish absurdities and atrocities in the way of rhyme 
might have been trusted to rot unobserved save of some 
rare collector of strange and worthless things. But to 
have them bound up with the ripest work of the first 
lyric poet of England, tied on as it were to the tail or 
pinned to the back of a volume which undertakes to 
give us for the first time a critical text of Shelley, is a 
thing not to be endured or extenuated.^ The argument 
or apology of the editor on behalf of this lamentable act 
of caprice has not I believe made a single convert, and 
is I should hope not likely to make one. Those wha 
did most justice to the zealous labour and the strenuous 
devotion of Mr. Rossetti, those who were the first to 
recognise with all gratitude what thanks were due to his 
ardour and ability, were the first to utter their protest 

' An edition of Shelley which should give us a final standard o£ 
the text would naturally rel^ate '* Queen Mab" to its proper place 
in an appendix. The strong and sincere protest of Shelley against 
the piratical reissue of this poem, backed by the frank and reasonable avowal that he was ashamed of the bad poetry contained in it, 
should have sufficed to exclude it from the station at the head of his 
works which it has so long been permitted to retain. Full of intellectual power and promise as it is, a poem repudiated by its 
author as unworthy of his maturer fame should never have beox 
Uirust into the place which obviously belongs to ** Alastor ;" for it 
is only with this later work that the real career of Shelley as a poet 
may be properly said to b^n.

against this the most unhappy and perverse example on 
record of a pernicious exactitude in the collection and 
preservation of all that an author would desire to efface 
from his own and all men's memory. The first such 
protest, if I mistake not; was expressed in earnest and 
weighty words by Miss Mathilde Blind, whose admirable 
essay on Shelley was one of the* earliest and most notable 
signs of the impulse given to the critical study of the 
poet by the api)earance of this edition. That essay, full 
as it was of eloquent commentary and fervent thought, 
is yet more precious for its many contributions to the pure 
and perfect text of Shelley which we hope before long to 
see ; no pedagogic emendations or professorial conjectures, 
but restorations supplied from the poef s own manuscript ; 
and, more than all, for the completion of that faultless 
poem called "The Question" by one long-lost line of 
final loveliness. 

It would be a pleasanter task than that of fault-finding 
or protesting, to pass once more through the glorious 
gaUery of Shelley's works in the company of his first 
critical editor, and note down what points of consent 
or dissent might occur to us in the process of comparing 
opinions as to this poem or that But time and space 
forbid me to do more than register my own opinion as 
to the respective value of two among the latest, and to 
express the surprise which I share with Miss Blind at the 
station assigned by Mr. Rossetti to the "Witch of 
Atlas," which he deliberately ranks above the " EpipsychicUon," It is indeed an exquisite exercise of simny 
and flowery fancy, which probably was designed to cover 
or convey no such elaborate allegoric significance as the 



236 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 

editor seems willing to seek in it; the "lady witch" 
being simply an incarnation of ideal beauty and beneficence, in her relations to man a spiritual patroness of 
free thought and free love, in her relations to nature a 
mistress or an adept of her secret rites or forces. Nor 
does it seem to me that Mr. Rossetti has touched on 
th^ one point where the " Epipsychidion " might be 
plausibly represented as open to attack. Its impalpable 
and ethereal philosophy of love and life does not prevent 
it from being " quite a justifiable sort of poem to write ; " 
the questionable element in it is the apparent introduction 
of such merely personal allusions as can only perplex 
and irritate the patience and intelligence of a loyal 
student, while they may not impossibly afford an opening 
for preposterous and even offensive interpretations. In 
all poetry as in all religions, mysteries must have place, 
but riddles should find none. The high, sweet, mystic 
doctrine of this poem is apprehensible Plough to all who 
look into it with purged eyes and listen with purged ears ; 
but the passages in which the special experience of the 
writer is thrust forward under the mask and muffler of 
all^oric rhapsody are not in any proper sense mysterious; 
they are simply puzzling ; and art should have nothing 
to do with puzzles. This, and this alone, is the fiuilt 
which in my opinion may be not imreasonably foimd 
with some few passages of the " Epipsychidion ; '* and a 
fault so slight and partial as merely to affect some few 
passages here and there, perceptible only in the byways 
and outskirts of the poem, can in no degree impair the 
divine perfection of its charm^ the savour of its heavenly 
quality. By the depth and exaltation of its dominant 



NOTES ON THE TEXT OF SHELLEY. 237 

idea, by the rapture of the music and the glory of the 
colour which dothe with sound and splendoiu: the subtle 
and luminous body of its thought, by the harmony of its 
most passionate notes and the hiunanity of its most godlike raptures, it holds a foremost place in the works of 
that poet who has now for two generations ruled and 
moulded the hearts and minds of all among his countrymen to whom the love of poetry has been more than a 
&ncy or a fashion ; who has led them by the light of his 
faith, by the spell of his hope, by the fire of his love, on 
the way of thought which he himself had followed in the 
track of the greatest who had gone before him — of 
iEschylus, of Lucretius, of Milton ; who has been more 
to us than ever was Byron to the youth of his own brief 
day, than ever was Wordsworth to the students of the 
day succeeding ; and of whom, whether we class him as 
second or as third among English poets, it must be in 
either case conceded that he holds the same rank in lyric 
as Shakespeare in dramatic poetry — supreme, and without 
a second of his race. I would not pit his name against 
the sacred name of Milton; to wrangle for the precedence of this immortal or of thdt can be but futile and 
injurious; it is enough that our country may count 
among her sons two of the greatest among those great 
poets who have also been prophets and evangelists of 
personal and national, social and spiritual freedom ; but 
it is equally certain that of all forms or kinds of poetry 
the two highest are the l3rric and the dramatic, and that 
as clearly as the first place in the one rank is held among; 
us by Shakespeare, the first place in the other is held and 
will never be resigned by Shelley.

BYRON. 

[Prefatory Note. — This, like the following essay, was 
prefixed to a small volume of selections from the poems 
of the author whose genius is the subject of discussion. 
To the work of Coleridge this process of selection, if adequately carried out, must have been, as Leigh Hunt long 
since suggested, a real and great service ; for his work is 
distinctly divisible into good and bad, durable and perishable ; and it would be a clear gain to have the priceless 
parts of that work detached from the worthless ; but to 
Byron, who rarely wrote anything either worthless or 
faultless, it could not be otherwise than injurious. He 
can only be judged or appreciated in the mass; the 
greatest of his works was his whole work taken altogether ; and to know or to honour him aright he must be 
considered with all his imperfections and with all his 
glories on his head.] 



The most delicate and thoughtful of English critics has 
charged the present generation of Englishmen with 
forgetfulness of Byron. It is not a light charge : and it 
is not ungrounded. Men bom when this century was 
getting into its forties were baptized into another church

than his with the rites of another creed. Upon their 
ears, first after the cadences of elder poets, fell the 
faultless and fervent melodies of Tennyson. To them, 
chief among the past heroes of the younger century, 
three men appeared as predominant in poetry; Coleridge, Keats, and Shelley. Behind these were effaced, on 
either hand, the two great opposing figures of Byron and 
Wordsworth. No man under twenty can just now be 
expected to appreciate these. The time was when all 
boys and girls who paddled in rhyme and dabbled in 
sentiment were wont to adore the presence or the 
memory of Byron with foolish faces of praise. It is of 
little moment to him or to us that they have long since 
ceased to cackle and begun to hiss. They have become 
used to better verse and carefuller workmen ; and must 
be forgiven if after such training they cannot at once 
appreciate the splendid and imperishable excellence 
which covers all his offences and outweighs all his 
defects: the excellence of sincerity and strength. 
Without these no poet can live ; but few have ever had 
so much of them as Byron. His sincerity indeed is 
difficult to discover and define ; but it does in effect lie 
at the root of all his good works : deformed by pretension and defaced by assumption, masked by folly 
and veiled by affectation ; but perceptible after all, and 
priceless. 

It is no part of my present office to rewrite the

or extricated, which may affect for the better or the 
worse our judgment of the man, it will be possible and 
necessary to rewrite it Meantime this among other 
chances "lies on the lap of the gods ;" and especially 
on the lap of a goddess who still treads our earth. Until 
she speaks, we cannot guess what she may have to say ; 
and can only pass by with reverent or with sceptical 
reticence.^ 

Thus much however we may safely assert : that no 
man's work was ever more influenced by his character ; 
and that no man's character was ever more influencedby 
his circumstances. Rather from things without than 
from things within him did the spirit of Byron assume 
colour and shape. His noblest verse leapt on a sudden 

' It will be evident that these lines were written before the 
appearance of the book in which Madame de Boissjr thought fit to 
let the world know that she had noilhing to tell "worth its hearing 
with regard to the man whose love had made her famous, but was 
not the less willing to put forth that nothing in two leaden volumes 
of verbiage. The worst consequence of this miscarriage was not 
the collapse of such faint hopes or surmises as we might yet have 
cherished of some benefit to be received in the way of biography, 
some new and kindly light to be thrown on the life and character of 
B)rron ; it was the opportunity given to a filthy female moralist and 
novelist who was not slow to avail herself of such an occasion " to 
expound her beastly mind to all." Evidently the laurels of Mrs. 
Behn had long kept her successor from sleeping ; it was not enough 
to have copied the authoress of ** Oroonoko " in the selection of a 
sable and a servile hero ; her American imitator was bent on following her down fouler ways than this. But I feel that an apolc^ is 
due to the virtuous memory of the chaste Aphra; she was indeed 
the first ** nigger novelist," and she was likewise a vendor and 
purveyor of obscene fiction ; but here the parallel ends ; for I am not 
aware that she ever applied her unquestionable abilities in that 
unlovely line of business to the de£unation at second hand of the 
illustrious and defenceless dead.

into life after the heaviest evils had fallen upon him which 
even he ever underwent From the beginning indeed he 
had much to iight against ; and three impediments hung 
about him at starting, the least of which would have 
weighed down a less strong man : youth, and genius, and 
an ancient name.^ In spite of all three he made his 
way ;~ and suttered for it At the first chance given or 
taken, every obscure and obscene thing that lurks for 
pay or prey among the fouler shallows and thickets of 
literature flew against him; every hound and every 
hireling lavished upon him the loathsome tribute of their 
abuse ; all nameless creatures that nibble and prowl, 
upon whom the serpent's curse has fallen, to go upon his 
belly and eat dust all the days of his life, assailed him 
with their foulest venom and their keenest fangs. And 
the promise given of old to their kind was now at least fulfilled : they did bruise his heel. But the heads of such 
creatures are so small that it is hard to bruise them in 
return ; it would first be necessary to discern them. 

That Byron was able to disregard and to outlive the 
bark and the bite of such curs as these is small praise 
enough : the man who cannot do as much is destructible^ 
and therefore contemptible. He did far more than this ; 
he withstood the weight of circumstances to the end ; 

' That his youth and his rank were flung in his face with vulgar 
insolence on the publication of his first little book jt can hardly be 
necessary to remind any reader of Byron ; but possibly even these 
offences might have been condoned in a scribbler whose work had 
given no offensive promise of greatness yet to be. In the verses on 
Lochnagar at least an ominous threat or presage of something new 
and splendid must have been but too perceptible to the discerning 
eye of criticism.

not always without complaint, but always without misgiving. His glorious courage, his excellent contempt for V 
things contemptible, and hatred of hateful men, are 
enough of themselves to em1)alm and endearlus' memory 
in the eyes of all who are worthy to pass judgment upon 
him, And these qualities gave much of their own value 
to verse not otherwise or not always praiseworthy. Even 
at its best, the serious poetry of Byron is often so rough 
and loose, so weak in the screws and joints which hold 
together the framework of verse, that it is not easy to 
praise it enough without seeming to condone or to 
extenuate such faults as should not be overlooked or 
forgiven. No poet is so badly represented by a book of 
selections. It must show something of his weakness ; it 
cannot show all of his strength. Often, after a noble 
overture, the last note struck is either dissonant or 
inefifectuaL His magnificent masterpiece, which must 
endure for ever among the precious relics of the world, 
will not bear dissection or extraction. The merit of 
" Don Juan '* does not lie in any part, but in t he whole . 
There is in that great poem an especial and exquisite 
balance and sustenance of alternate tones which cannot 
be expressed or explained by tlie utmost ingenuity of 
selection. Haid^e is supplanted by Dudh, the shipwreck by the siege, the Russian court by the E^lish 
household ; and this perpetual change, this tidal variety 
of experience and emotion, gives to the poem something 
of the breadth and freshness of the sea. Much of the 
poet* s earlier work is or seems unconsciously dishonest ; 
this, if not always or wholly unaffected, is as honest as the 
sunlight, as frank as the sea- wind. Here, and here alone.

the student of his work may recognise and enjoy the ebb 
and flow of actual life. Here the pulse of vital blood may 
be felt in tangible flesh. Here for the first time the style of 
Byron is beyond all praise or blame : a style at once 
swift and supple, light and strong, various and radiant 
Between " Childe Harold " and " Don Juan " the same 
difference exists which a swimmer feels between lakewater and sea-water: the one is fluent> yielding, invariable ; the other has in it a life and pulse, aTstihg and 
a swell, which touch and excite the nerves like fire or like 
music. Across the stanzas of " Don Juan ** we siirim 
forward as over " the broad backs of the sea " ; they 
break and glitter, hiss and laugh, murmur and move, 
like waves that sound or that subside. There is in them 
a delicious resistance, an elastic motion, which salt water 
has and fresh w^ter has not There is about them a 
wide wholesome air, fiiU of vivid light and cqnstant wind, 
which is only felt at sea. Life undulates and death 
palpitates in the splendid verse which resumes the 
evidence of a brave and clear-sighted man concerning 
life and death. Here, as at sea, there is enough and too 
much of fluctuation and intermission ; the ripple flags 
and falls in loose and lazy lines : the foam flies wide of 
any mark, and the breakers collapse here and there in 
sudden ruin and violent failure. But the violence and 
weakness of the sea are preferable to the smooth soimd 
and equable seciuity of a lake : its buoyant and progressive impulse sustains and propels those who would 
sink through weariness in the flat and placid shallows. 
There are others whom it sickens, and others whom it 

chills ; these will do well to steer inshore.
