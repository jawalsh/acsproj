					<l n="10">In her I lived, and in me she is slain,</l>
					<l n="11">Who loved me that I brought her to her doom,</l>

					<l n="43">How all these loving things that kill and die</l>
					<l n="44">Meet not but for a breath's space and pass by?</l>
					<l n="45">Night is kissed once of dawn and dies, and day</l>

							Gouvernayle</persName> his squire, that watched hard by,</l>
					<l n="113">Sought where perchance a man might win ashore,</l>
					<l n="114">Striving, with strong limbs labouring long and sore,</l>
					<l n="115">And there abode an hour: till as from fight</l>
					<l n="116">Crowned with hard conquest won by mastering might,</l>
					<l n="117">Hardly, but happier for the imperious toil,</l>
					<l n="118">Swam the knight in forth of the close waves' coil,</l>
					<l n="119">Sea-satiate, bruised with buffets of the brine,</l>
					<l n="120">Laughing, and flushed as one afire with wine:</l>
					<l n="121">All this came hard upon him in a breath;</l>
					<l n="122">And how he marvelled in his heart that death</l>
					<pb n="72" facs="acs0000001-04-083"/>
					<l n="123">Should be no bitterer than it seemed to be</l>
					<l n="124">There, in the strenuous impulse of the sea</l>
					<l n="125">Borne as to battle deathward: and at last</l>
					<l n="126">How all his after seasons overpast</l>
					<l n="127">Had brought him darkling to this dark sweet hour,</l>
					<l n="128">Where his foot faltered nigh the bridal bower.</l>
					<l n="129">And harder seemed the passage now to pass,</l>
					<l n="130">Though smoother-seeming than the still sea's glass,</l>
					<l n="131">More fit for very manhood's heart to fear,</l>
					<l n="132">Than all straits past of peril. Hardly here</l>
					<l n="133">Might aught of all things hearten him save one,</l>
					<l n="134">Faith: and as men's eyes quail before the sun</l>
					<l n="135">So quailed his heart before the star whose light</l>
					<l n="136">Put out the torches of his bridal night,</l>
					<l n="137">So quailed and shrank with sense of faith's keen star</l>
					<l n="138">That burned as fire beheld by night afar</l>
					<l n="139">Deep in the darkness of his dreams; for all</l>
					<l n="140">The bride-house now seemed hung with heavier pall</l>
					<l n="141">Than clothes the house of mourning. Yet at last,</l>
					<l n="142">Soul-sick with trembling at the heart, he passed</l>
					<l n="143">Into the sweet light of the maiden bower</l>
					<l n="144">Where lay the lonely lily-featured flower</l>
					<l n="145">That, lying within his hand to gather, yet</l>
					<l n="146">Might not be gathered of it. Fierce regret</l>
					<l n="147">And bitter loyalty strove hard at strife</l>
					<l n="148">With amorous pity toward the tender wife</l>
					<l n="149">That wife indeed might never be, to wear</l>
					<l n="150">The very crown of wedlock; never bear</l>
					<l n="151">Children, to watch and worship her white hair</l>
					<l n="152">When time should change, with hand more soft than snow,</l>
					<l n="153">The fashion of its glory; never know</l>
					<l n="154">The loveliness of laughing love that lives</l>
					<l n="155">On little lips of children: all that gives</l>
					<pb n="73" facs="acs0000001-04-084"/>
					<l n="156">Glory and grace and reverence and delight</l>
					<l n="157">To wedded woman by her bridal right,</l>
					<l n="158">All praise and pride that flowers too fair to fall,</l>
					<l n="159">Love that should give had stripped her of them all</l>
					<l n="160">And left her bare for ever. So his thought</l>
					<l n="161">Consumed him, as a fire within that wrought</l>
					<l n="162">Visibly, ravening till its wrath were spent:</l>
					<l n="163">So pale he stood, so bowed and passion-rent,</l>
					<l n="164">Before the blithe-faced bride-folk, ere he went</l>
					<l n="165">Within the chamber, heavy-eyed: and there</l>
					<l n="166">Gleamed the white hands and glowed the glimmering hair</l>
					<l n="167">That might but move his memory more of one more fair,</l>
					<l n="168">More fair than all this beauty: but in sooth</l>
					<l n="169">So fair she too shone in her flower of youth</l>
					<l n="170">That scarcely might man's heart hold fast its truth,</l>
					<l n="171">Though strong, who gazed upon her: for her eyes</l>
					<l n="172">Were emerald-soft as evening-coloured skies,</l>
					<l n="173">And a smile in them like the light therein</l>
					<l n="174">Slept, or shone out in joy that knew not sin,</l>
					<l n="175">Clear as a child's own laughter: and her mouth,</l>
					<l n="176">Albeit no rose full-hearted from the south</l>
					<l n="177">And passion-coloured for the perfect kiss</l>
					<l n="178">That signs the soul for love and stamps it his,</l>
					<l n="179">Was soft and bright as any bud new-blown;</l>
					<l n="180">And through her cheek the gentler lifebloom shone</l>
					<l n="181">Of mild wild roses nigh the northward sea.</l>
					<l n="182">So in her bride-bed lay the bride: and he</l>
					<l n="183">Drew nigh, and all the high sad heart in him</l>
					<l n="184">Yearned on her, seeing the twilight meek and dim</l>
					<l n="185">Through all the soft alcove tremblingly lit</l>
					<l n="186">With hovering silver, as a heart in it</l>
					<pb n="74" facs="acs0000001-04-085"/>
					<l n="187">Beating, that burned from one deep lamp above,</l>
					<l n="188">Fainter than fire of torches, as the love</l>
					<l n="189">Within him fainter than a bridegroom's fire,</l>
					<l n="190">No marriage-torch red with the heart's desire,</l>
					<l n="191">But silver-soft, a flameless light that glowed</l>
					<l n="192">Starlike along night's dark and starry road</l>
					<l n="193">Wherein his soul was traveller. And he sighed,</l>
					<l n="194">Seeing, and with eyes set sadly toward his bride</l>
					<l n="195">Laid him down by her, and spake not: but within</l>
					<l n="196">His heart spake, saying how sore should be the sin</l>
					<l n="197">To break toward her, that of all womankind</l>
					<l n="198">Was faithfullest, faith plighted, or unbind</l>
					<l n="199">The bond first linked between them when they drank</l>
					<l n="200">The love-draught: and his quick blood sprang and sank,</l>
					<l n="201">Remembering in the pulse of all his veins</l>
					<l n="202">That red swift rapture, all its fiery pains</l>
					<l n="203">And all its fierier pleasures: and he spake</l>
					<l n="204">Aloud, one burning word for love's keen sake —</l>
					<l n="205">"<persName key="iseult" xml:id="persName_283">Iseult</persName>;" and full of love and lovelier fear</l>
					<l n="206">A virgin voice gave answer — "I am here."</l>
					<l n="207">And a pang rent his heart at root: but still,</l>
					<l n="208">For spirit and flesh were vassals to his will,</l>
					<l n="209">Strong faith held mastery on them: and the breath</l>
					<l n="210">Felt on his face did not his will to death,</l>
					<l n="211">Nor glance nor lute-like voice nor flower-soft touch</l>
					<l n="212">Might so prevail upon it overmuch</l>
					<l n="213">That constancy might less prevail than they,</l>
					<l n="214">For all he looked and loved her as she lay</l>
					<l n="215">Smiling; and soft as bird alights on bough</l>
					<l n="216">He kissed her maiden mouth and blameless brow,</l>
					<l n="217">Once, and again his heart within him sighed:</l>
					<l n="218">But all his young blood's yearning toward his bride,</l>
					<pb n="75" facs="acs0000001-04-086"/>
					<l n="219">How hard soe'er it held his life awake</l>
					<l n="220">For passion, and sweet nature's unforbidden sake,</l>
					<l n="221">And will that strove unwillingly with will it might not break,</l>
					<l n="222">Fell silent as a wind abashed, whose breath</l>
					<l n="223">Dies out of heaven, suddenly done to death,</l>
					<l n="224">When in between them on the dumb dusk air</l>
					<l n="225">Floated the bright shade of a face more fair</l>
					<l n="226">Than hers that hard beside him shrank and smiled</l>
					<l n="227">And wist of all no more than might a child.</l>
					<l n="228">So had she all her heart's will, all she would,</l>
					<l n="229">For love's sake that sufficed her, glad and good,</l>
					<l n="230">All night safe sleeping in her maidenhood.</l>

					<l n="613">And halting fared through his own gate, and fell,</l>
					<l n="614">Thirsting: for as the sleepless fire of hell</l>
					<l n="615">The fire within him of his wound again</l>
					<l n="616">Burned, and his face was dark as death for pain,</l>
					<l n="617">And blind the blithe light of his eyes: but they</l>
					<l n="618">Within that watched and wist not of the fray</l>
					<l n="619">Came forth and cried aloud on him for woe.</l>

					<l n="621">As men reared up the strong man fallen and bore</l>
					<l n="622">Down the deep hall that looked along the shore,</l>

					<l n="626">All, and drew nigh, and spake no wifely word,</l>
					<l n="627">But gazed upon him doubtfully, with eyes</l>
					<l n="628">Clouded; and he in kindly knightly wise</l>
					<l n="629">Spake with scant breath, and smiling: "Surely this</l>

					<l n="634">Her head, still silent as a stooping cloud,</l>
					<l n="635">And laid her lips against his face; and he</l>
					<l n="636">Felt sink a shadow across him as the sea</l>
					<l n="637">Might feel a cloud stoop toward it: and his heart</l>
					<l n="638">Darkened as one that wastes by sorcerous art</l>
					<l n="639">And knows not whence it withers: and he turned</l>
					<l n="640">Back from her emerald eyes his own, and yearned</l>
					<l n="641">All night for eyes all golden: and the dark</l>
					<l n="642">Hung sleepless round him till the loud first lark</l>
					<l n="643">Rang record forth once more of darkness done,</l>

					<l n="550">With prayer of him for pardon: and his heart</l>

					<pb n="151" facs="acs0000001-04-162"/>
					<l n="567">For many a fathom gleams and moves and moans</l>
					<l n="568">The tide that sweeps above their coffined bones</l>
					<l n="569">In the wrecked chancel by the shivered shrine:</l>
					<l n="570">Nor where they sleep shall moon or sunlight shine</l>
					<l n="571">Nor man look down for ever: none shall say,</l>
					<l n="572">Here once, or here, <persName key="tristram" xml:id="persName_464">Tristram</persName> and <persName key="iseult" xml:id="persName_037">Iseult</persName> lay:</l>
					<l n="573">But peace they have that none may gain who live,</l>
					<l n="574">And rest about them that no love can give,</l>
					<l n="575">And over them, while death and life shall be,</l>
					<l n="576">The light and sound and darkness of the sea.</l>

				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l n="478">“For all this deadly work was wrought</l>

					<pb n="231" facs="acs0000001-04-242"/>
					<l n="528">They twain, free now from hopes and fears,</l>
					<l n="529">Might sleep; and she, as one that hears,</l>
					<l n="530">Bowed her bright head: and very tears</l>
					<l n="531" rendition="#ti-2">Fell from her cold fierce eyes.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l n="532">Then <persName>Balen</persName> prayed her send a priest</l>

					<l n="539">And death's and life's dim sunlit mist</l>
					<l n="540" rendition="#ti-2">Pass as a stream that ran.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l n="541">And so their dying rites were done:</l>
					<l n="542">And <persName>Balen</persName>, seeing the death-struck sun</l>
					<l n="543">Sink, spake as he whose goal is won:</l>
					<l n="544">“Now, when our trophied tomb is one,</l>
					<l n="545" rendition="#ti-2">And over us our tale is writ,</l>
					<l n="546">How two that loved each other, two</l>
