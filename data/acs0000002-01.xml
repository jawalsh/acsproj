        <list>
        <item>Missing whitespace between tagged words and surrounding tags/text results in unwanted running-together of words in the output. 
          Whitespace needs to be inserted.</item>
        <item>Need to include <gi>persName</gi> tag around all names, and where appropriate, @rendition can be moved from the child "name" element, e.g., <gi>forename</gi>, <gi>roleName</gi>, to the parent <gi>persName</gi>.</item>

<l>That if you do me there a word of wrong,</l>
<l>Yea the thin grain of one particular word,</l>
<l>The same is worse than ill. I pardon it.</l>
<l>That I do love you, God shall do me right</l>

<l>You do both stray: give me some leave to speak,</l>

<l>Though I might say, and no man cross the lie,</l>
  <pb n="71" facs="acs0000002-01-088"/>
<l>That in the personal state of mine esteem</l>
<l>I have kept endurance on against a wrong</l>
<l>That might put blood i’ the dead. My royal father,</l>
<l>Whose cost did earn the sum of such a name,</l>
<l>Yea, even to full repute; whose motive hand</l>
<l>Did the most inward ties of war unloose,</l>
<l>And pluck its joint away; this man so built,</l>
<l>So strained and clean of any weak revolt</l>
<l>That faith herself did set her tongue by his</l>
<l>And use his lesson for her proper text;</l>
<l>This bulk and nerve of all your services</l>
<l>Fashioned in one man’s work; how he came dead</l>
<l>You twain are no whit less assured than I,</l>
<l>Who have thrown beyond conjecture. It is poor truth</l>
<l>To say we think that he fared treacherously;</l>
<l>If knowledge be no weaker than report,</l>
<l>And proof no looser than a popular mouth,</l>
<l>Then we do know it. O, such a want we have,</l>
<l>So dear and so entire a loss in him,</l>
<l>As should make France the book of all men’s griefs,</l>
<l>The mould wherein a very face of sorrow</l>

<l>Both you dare swear: that it is not my shame,</l>

<l>Will you find sufferance smoother-faced than mine?</l>
<l>Have I borne much? or is there fault in me,</l>
<l>Who am the limit of endurances?</l>
<l>Now in this very point of patience here,</l>

<l>Being thus, I doubt it is not well at all.</l>
<l>A father slain is more than so much bones</l>
<l>That worms and flies dishallow, being thin dust</l>
<l>And out of value; and personally to me</l>
<l>It is much more. I will not have this way;</l>
<l>Lest my most loving honour borne to you</l>
<l>Leave me ashamed, or service done disbark</l>
<l>All graces from me. You were strongly sworn,</l>
<l>Yea, with the assurance that all faith makes up,</l>
<l>To help us mend the ravelled rents of time;</l>
<l>But though you had more iron in your hand</l>
<l>Than you have yet, you cannot grasp therein</l>
<l>Two faiths, two sides, two justices at once.</l>
<l>Choose you, and put good will to choice; for me,</l>
<l>I am not thralled in your election.</l>

<l>It is the time; had but this solid earth</l> 
<l>A capable sense of peril, it should melt</l> 
<l>And all disjoint itself; the builded shape of things</l> 
<l>Should turn to waste and air. It is as strange</l> 
<l>As is this perilous intent, that men</l> 
<l>Should live so evenly to-night; talk, move,</l> 
<l>Use contemplation of all common times,</l> 
<l>Speak foolishly, make no more haste to sleep</l> 
<l>Than other days they do; I have not seen</l> 
<l>A man to-day seem graver in the mouth,</l> 
<l>Wear slowness on his feet, look sideways out,</l> 
<l>Make new the stuff and subject of his speech,</l> 
<l>Reason of things, matter of argument,</l> 
<l>For such a business. I see death is not feared,</l> 
<l>Only the circumstance and clothes of death;</l> 
<l>Or else men do not commune more with time</l> 
<l>Nor have its purpose in them larger writ</l> 
<l>Than a beast has. Why, I did surely think</l> 
<l>Such ill foreknowledge would have mastered me</l> 
<l>Quite beyond reason; wrenched my sense away,</l> 
<l>Brought it to dull default. But I do live and stir;</l> 
<l>Have reasonable breath within my lips:</l> 
<l>Keep my brain sound, and all my settled blood</l> 
<l>Runs the right way. Perhaps I sleep and dream</l> 
<l>That such things are as my fear dotes upon.</l> 
<l>Why then I should be mad; and being mad</l> 
<l>I might hold sound opinion of my wit</l>
  
  <pb n="183" facs="acs0000002-01-200"/>
  
<l>When it were truly flawed. If I not dream</l> 
<l>And have no passionate mixture in my brain,</l> 
<l>Large massacre to-night should fill itself</l> 
<l>With slaughtered blood and the live price of men.</l> 
<l>Why this? forsooth because of that and that,</l> 
<l>For this man’s tongue and that man’s beard or gait,</l> 
<l>For some rank slip of their opinion.</l> 
<l>I see full reason why men slay for hate,</l> 
<l>But for opinion or slack accident</l> 
<l>I get no cause at all. Then I am mad</l> 
<l>That I do think what works so much awry</l> 
<l>And is past reason so, the natural sense</l> 
<l>Doth sicken in receiving it for news,</l> 
<l>To be the absolute act and heart of truth.</l> 
<l>I will not credit this. Yet wherefore am I</l> 
<l>So used as prisoner here? why taxed with sin?</l> 
<l>Why watched and kept so hard? called murderess?</l>

<l>O girl, that hast no bitter touch of love,</l>
  
  <pb n="236" facs="acs0000002-01-253"/>
  
<l>No more assurance of it than report</l> 
<l>Flaunts in the teeth of blame—I bid you know</l> 
<l>Love is much wiser than we twain, more strong</l> 
<l>Than men who hold the pard by throat and jaw.</l> 
<l>Love’s signet-brand stamps through the gold o’the years,</l> 
<l>Severs the gross and chastens out the mould.</l> 
<l>God has no plague so perilous as love,</l> 
<l>And no such honey for the lips of Christ</l> 
<l>To purge them clean of gall and sweet for heaven.</l> 
<l>It was to fit the naked limbs of love</l> 
<l>He wrought and clothed the world with ordinance.</l> 
<l>Yea, let no wiser woman hear me say</l> 
<l>I think that whoso shall unclothe his soul</l> 
<l>Of all soft raiment coloured custom weaves,</l> 
<l>And choose before the cushion-work of looms</l> 
<l>Stones rough at edge to stab the tender side,</l> 
<l>Put honour off and patience and respect</l> 
<l>And veils and relics of remote esteem</l> 
<l>To turn quite bare into large arms of love,</l> 
<l>God loves him better than those bitter fools</l> 
<l>Whom ignorance makes clean, and bloodless use</l> 
<l part="I">Keeps colder than their dreams.</l>

<l>Yea, I loathe Hugh. Peter he beat, and me—</l> 
<l>Me twice, because that day the <rs type="person">queen</rs> came in</l> 
<l>I twisted back my head to thrust well through</l> 
<l>The carved work’s double lattice to get sight</l> 
<l>Of a tall woman with gold clothes and hair</l> 
<l>That shone beyond her clothes; so sharp he smote,</l> 
<l>The grim beast Hugh with boarish teeth and hair</l> 
<l>All his chin long and where no hair should be!</l> 
<l>And Peter pinched and pushed all vespers through</l> 
<l>To get my turn and see her. How she went</l> 
<l>Holding her throat up, with her round neck out</l> 
<l>Curdwhite, no clot in it not smooth to stroke—</l> 
<l>All night I shook in sleep for that one thing,</l> 
<l>Stirred with my feet and pulled about awry.</l>
  
  <pb n="267" facs="acs0000002-01-284"/>
  
<l>I think too she kept smiling with her mouth</l> 
<l>(Her wonderful red quiet mouth) and prayed</l> 
<l>All to herself. Now that men call a mouth—</l> 
<l>And Hugh’s begrimed big lips you call the same</l> 
<l>That make a thick smile up with all their fat</l> 
<l>Never but when he gets one by the nape</l> 
<l>To make him sprawl and weep. How all the hair</l> 
<l>Drew the hard shining of the candle-fires</l> 
<l>And shone back harder with a flare in it</l> 
<l>Through all the plaits and bands. Then Hugh said—“Look,</l> 
  <l>You <persName>Arthur</persName>, that white woman with such eyes</l> 
<l>Is worse in hell than any devil that seethes;</l> 
<l>She keeps the colour of it in her hair</l> 
<l>That shakes like flame so. Wait till I get in</l> 
<l>And teach the beast’s will in your female flesh</l> 
<l>With some red slits in it, to get out loose</l> 
<l>In such dog’s ways.” But Hugh lied hard, I think;</l> 
<l>For he said after in his damned side-room</l> 
<l>What fierce account God made of such a name</l> 
<l>And how the golden <rs type="person">king</rs> that made God songs</l> 
<l>Chid at their ways and called them this and that;</l> 
<l>And he loved many queens with just such hair</l> 
<l>And such good eyes, and had more scores of them</l> 
<l>Than I have stripes since last red week on me.</l> 
<l>So I can see Hugh lied. For no Jew’s wife</l> 
<l>Looked ever so, or found such ways to hold</l> 
<l>Her sweet straight body.—But my next—that’s hard.</l>

<l><hi rendition="#sc">Late</hi>summer now, but in the fair blue spring</l>
<l>How shall God bear me? Once (men say) Lord Christ</l> 
<l>Walked between rivers in his rose-garden</l> 
<l>With some old saint who had a wife by him</l> 
<l>To feed with apple-pulp and honeycomb,</l> 
<l>A wife like Mary in <rs type="person">king</rs> David’s time</l> 
<l>Long after—but a snake so stung his foot</l> 
<l>He came back never, being lame at heel.</l> 
<l>A story some priest wrote out all in gold,</l> 
<l>Painting the leaves green, for a <rs type="person">king</rs> to read;</l> 
<l>But the <rs type="person">king</rs> burnt it; whom God therefore took</l> 
<l>And sold him to some Turk, with eyes thrust out.</l> 
<l>Here in my garden, now his feet are healed</l> 
<l>From those twin stains where bit the hanging-nails,</l> 
<l>He would not come to let me kiss them whole,</l> 
<l>Wash them with oil and wet fruits bruised to juice,</l>
  
  <pb n="276" facs="acs0000002-01-293"/>
  
<l>Rare waters stained and scented through with rose—</l> 
<l>Though my hair be as long as Magdalen’s,</l> 
<l>As yellow, maybe. Mine eyes and eyelids ache,</l> 
<l>Too thick to see past, weeping swells them blue;</l> 
<l>And the veins narrow visibly and waste</l> 
<l>Where next the elbow neither hand could span;</l> 
<l>The flesh that wore glad colour is gone grey,</l> 
<l>And soon the hair will; yea, not milk but blood</l> 
<l>Fills my breast through, not good for any child</l> 
<l>To lay sweet lips to; I am as a gold cup</l> 
<l>With beaten edges and dry mouths of dust,</l> 
<l>That tears weep into, and that cunning man</l> 
<l>By whose wit I was fashioned lets them run</l> 
<l>And lets men break me. If I were well dead,</l> 
<l>Then were the tears all spilled over the ground</l> 
<l>And I made empty; also I pray God</l> 
<l>To get me broken quickly; else, who knows,</l> 
<l>If I live long till these years too seem grey</l> 
<l>As a flower ruined, then ere sleep at night</l> 
<l>I shall be grown too stark and thin to pray,</l> 
<l>Nor will God care to set me praying then.</l> 
<l>Maids will keep round me, girls with smooth warm hair</l> 
<l>When mine is hard, no silk in it to feel,—</l> 
<l>Tall girls to dress me, laughing underbreath,</l> 
<l>Too low for gold to tighten at the waist.</l>
<l>Eh, the hinge sharpens at the grate across?</l> 
<l>Five minutes now to get the green walk through</l> 
<l>And turn—the chestnut leaves will take his hair</l> 
<l>If he turn quick; or I shall hear some bud</l> 
<l>Fall, or some pebble’s clink along the fence</l> 
<l>Or stone his heel grinds, or torn lime-blossom</l> 
<l>Flung at me from behind; not poppies now</l> 
<l>Nor marigolds, but rose and lime-flower.</l>

<l>A poor man puts away for idleness,</l>

<l>A little sad word said inside her ears</l> 
<l>To make them burn for piteous shame? you see</l> 
<l>How I weep, yea, fear wrings my body round;</l> 
<l>You know not hardly how afraid I am,</l> 
<l>But my throat sickens with pure fear, my blood</l> 
<l>Falls marred in me; and God should love you so</l> 
<l>Being found his friend and made compassionate—</l>

<l>Sir, pardon me, I know she is but dead,</l>

<l>See how strong laughter takes her by the throat</l> 
<l>And plucks her lips! her teeth would bite, no doubt,</l> 
<l>But she keeps quiet; she should live indeed;</l> 
<l>She hath mere motion, and such life in her</l> 
<l>Accuses and impeaches the Lord God,</l> 
<l>Who wrought so miserably the shapes of man</l>
