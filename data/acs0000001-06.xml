								<l n="196" rendition="#ti-1">Of strife more vain than the sea's old strife.</l>
								<l n="197">And her heart within her was vexed, and dizzy</l>
								<l n="198" rendition="#ti-1">The sense of her soul as a wheel that whirled:</l>

								<l n="200" rendition="#ti-3">Loud coil of the troublous world.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l n="201">Too full, she said, was the world of trouble,</l>

								<l n="203">And shows less bright than the blithe foam's bubble</l>
								<l n="204" rendition="#ti-1">As home she fared on the smooth wind's wings.</l>
								<l n="205">For joy grows loftier in air more lonely,</l>
								<l n="206" rendition="#ti-1">Where only the sea's brood fain would be;</l>
								<l n="207">Where only the heart may receive in it only</l>

                <l n="2">Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone:</l>
                <l n="3">Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour</l>
                <l n="4">Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower</l>
                <l n="5">Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the starbright air</l>
                <l n="6">Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
                <l n="7">Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish awoke in the dark?</l>
                <l n="8">Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark.</l>
                <l n="9">Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky,</l>
                <l n="10">Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die.</l>
                <pb n="280" facs="acs0000001-06-297"/>
                <l n="11">Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire:</l>
                <l n="12">Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
                <l n="13">And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free:</l>
                <l n="14">And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea.</l>
                <l n="15">All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught:</l>
                <l n="16">And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught.</l>
                <l n="17">And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind:</l>
                <l n="18">And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind.</l>
                <l n="19">Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce East,</l>
                <l n="20">Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest.</l>
                <l n="21">The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free</l>
                <l n="22">Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea.</l>
                <l n="23">As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall,</l>
                <l n="24">The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall.</l>
                <l n="25">Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath,</l>
                <l n="26">And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death.</l>
                <l n="27">Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy,</l>

                <l n="28">Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy.</l>
                <l n="29">For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime</l>
                <l n="30">As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time.</l>
                <l n="31">The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard,</l>
                <l n="32">The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word,</l>
                <l n="33">In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea,</l>
                <l n="34">And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free.</l>
                <l n="35">Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light</l>
                <l n="36">From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white.</l>
                <l n="37">The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade</l>
                <l n="38">From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made.</l>
                <l n="39">Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune,</l>
                <l n="40">Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon.</l>
                <l n="41">The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep</l>
                <l n="42">As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep.</l>
                <l n="43">All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know</l>
                <l n="44">Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below.</l>

                <l n="45">The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage,</l>
                <l n="46">Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage.</l>
                <l n="47">No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare,</l>
                <l n="48">Illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air—
                </l>
                <l n="49">Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's,</l>
                <l n="50">Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees.</l>
                <l n="51">No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams</l>
                <l n="52">Than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems—
                </l>
                <l n="53">One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides</l>
                <l n="54">As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides.</l>
                <l n="55">In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld</l>
                <l n="56">As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled.</l>
                <l n="57">As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn</l>
                <l n="58">Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn.</l>
                <l n="59">A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning sea,</l>
                <l n="60">And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be;</l>
                <l n="61">As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep,</l>
                <pb n="283" facs="acs0000001-06-300"/>
                <l n="62">Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep:</l>
                <l n="63">Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake:</l>
                <l n="64">Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake,</l>
                <l n="65">In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour,</l>
                <l n="66">A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower.</l>
                <l n="67">And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed</l>
                <l n="68">When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed.</l>
                <l n="69">The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died,</l>
                <l n="70">Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride;</l>
                <l n="71">With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth,</l>
                <l n="72">As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new God's birth,</l>
                <l n="73">The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell:</l>
                <l n="74">And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell.</l>
                <l n="75">The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain,</l>
                <l n="76">For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain.</l>
                <l n="77">And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife;</l>
                <l n="78">And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life.</l>

		<l n="1"><hi rendition="#sc">Light</hi> and night, whose clouds and glories change and mingle and divide,</l>
	<l n="2">Veil the truth whereof they witness, show the truth of things they hide.</l>
	<l n="3">Through the darkness and the splendour of the centuries, loud or dumb,</l>
	<l n="4">Shines and wanes and shines the spirit, lit with love of life to come.</l>
	<l n="5">Man, the soul made flesh, that knows not death from life, and fain would know,</l>
	<l n="6">Sees the face of time change colour as its tides recoil and flow.</l>
	<l n="7">All his hope and fear and faith and doubt, if aught at all they be,</l>
	<l n="8">Live the life of clouds and sunbeams, born of heaven or earth or sea.</l>
	<l n="9">All are buoyed and blown and brightened by their hour's evasive breath:</l>
	<l n="10">All subside and quail and darken when their hour is done to death.</l>
	<l n="11">Yet, ere faith, a wandering water, froze and curdled into creeds,</l>
	<l n="12">Earth, elate as heaven, adored the light that quickens dreams to deeds.</l>
    <pb n="304" facs="acs0000001-06-321"/>
	<l n="13">Invisible: eye hath not seen it, and ear hath not heard as the spirit hath heard</l>
	<l n="14">From the shrine that is lit not of sunlight or starlight the sound of a limitless word.</l>
	<l n="15">And visible: none that hath eyes to behold what the spirit must perish or see</l>
	<l n="16">Can choose but behold it and worship: a shrine that if light were as darkness would be.</l>
	<l n="17">Of cloud and of change is the form of the fashion that man may behold of it wrought:</l>
	<l n="18">Of iron and truth is the mystic mid altar, where worship is none but of thought.</l>
	<l n="19">No prayer may go up to it, climbing as incense of gladness or sorrow may climb:</l>
	<l n="20">No rapture of music may ruffle the silence that guards it, and hears not of time.</l>
	<l n="21">As the winds of the wild blind ages alternate in passion of light and of cloud,</l>
	<l n="22">So changes the shape of the veil that enshrouds it with darkness and light for a shroud.</l>
	<l n="23">And the winds and the clouds and the suns fall silent, and fade out of hearing or sight,</l>
	<l n="24">And the shrine stands fast and is changed not, whose likeness was changed as a cloud in the night.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
	<l n="25" rendition="#ti-1">All the storms of time, and wrath of many winds, may carve no trace</l>
	<l n="26" rendition="#ti-1">On the viewless altar, though the veil bear many a name and face:</l>
	<l n="27" rendition="#ti-1">Many a live God's likeness woven, many a scripture dark with awe,</l>
	<l n="28" rendition="#ti-1">Bids the veil seem verier iron than the word of life's own law.</l>
    <pb n="305" facs="acs0000001-06-322"/>
	<l n="29" rendition="#ti-1">Till the might of change hath rent it with a rushing wind in twain,</l>
	<l n="30" rendition="#ti-1">Stone or steel it seems, whereon the wrath of chance is wreaked in vain:</l>
	<l n="31" rendition="#ti-1">Stone or steel, and all behind it or beyond its lifted sign</l>
	<l n="32" rendition="#ti-1">Cloud and vapour, no subsistence of a change-unstricken shrine.</l>
	<l n="33" rendition="#ti-1">God by god flits past in thunder, till his glories turn to shades:</l>
	<l n="34" rendition="#ti-1">God to god bears wondering witness how his gospel flames and fades.</l>
	<l n="35" rendition="#ti-1">More was each of these, while yet they were, than man their servant seemed:</l>
	<l n="36" rendition="#ti-1">Dead are all of these, and man survives who made them while he dreamed.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
	<l n="37">Yet haply or surely, if vision were surer than theirs who rejoiced that they saw,</l>
	<l n="38">Man might not but see, through the darkness of godhead, the light that is surety and law.</l>
	<l n="39">On the stone that the close-drawn cloud which veils it awhile makes cloudlike stands</l>
	<l n="40">The word of the truth everlasting, unspoken of tongues and unwritten of hands.</l>
	<l n="41">By the sunbeams and storms of the centuries engraven, and approved of the soul as it reads,</l>
	<l n="42">It endures as a token dividing the light from the darkness of dreams and of deeds.</l>
	<l n="43">The faces of gods on the face of it carven, or gleaming behind and above,</l>
	<l n="44">Star-glorified Uranus, thunderous Jehovah, for terror or worship or love,</l>
    <pb n="306" facs="acs0000001-06-323"/>
	<l n="45">Change, wither, and brighten as flowers that the wind of eternity sheds upon time,</l>
	<l n="46">All radiant and transient and awful and mortal, and leave it unmarred and sublime.</l>
	<l n="47">As the tides that return and recede are the fears and the hopes of the centuries that roll,</l>
	<l n="48">Requenched and rekindled: but strong as the sun is the sense of it shrined in the soul.</l>

	<l n="49">In the days when time was not, in the time when days were none,</l>
	<l n="50">Ere sorrow had life to lot, ere earth gave thanks for the sun,</l>
	<l n="51">Ere man in his darkness waking adored what the soul in him could,</l>
	<l n="52">And the manifold God of his making was manifest evil and good,</l>
	<l n="53">One law from the dim beginning abode and abides in the end,</l>
	<l n="54">In sight of him sorrowing and sinning with none but his faith for friend.</l>
	<l n="55">Dark were the shadows around him, and darker the glories above,</l>
	<l n="56">Ere light from beyond them found him, and bade him for love's sake love.</l>
	<l n="57">About him was darkness, and under and over him darkness: the night</l>
	<l n="58">That conceived him and bore him had thunder for utterance and lightning for light.</l>
	<l n="59">The dust of death was the dust of the ways that the tribes of him trod:</l>
    <pb n="307" facs="acs0000001-06-324"/>
	<l n="60">And he knew not if just or unjust were the might of the mystery of God.</l>
	<l n="61">Strange horror and hope, strange faith and unfaith, were his boon and his bane:</l>
	<l n="62">And the God of his trust was the wraith of the soul or the ghost of it slain.</l>
	<l n="63">A curse was on death as on birth, and a Presence that shone as a sword</l>
	<l n="64">Shed menace from heaven upon earth that beheld him, and hailed him her Lord.</l>
	<l n="65">Sublime and triumphant as fire or as lightning, he kindled the skies,</l>
	<l n="66">And withered with dread the desire that would look on the light of his eyes.</l>
	<l n="67">Earth shuddered with worship, and knew not if hell were not hot in her breath;</l>
	<l n="68">If birth were not sin, and the dew of the morning the sweat of her death.</l>
	<l n="69">The watchwords of evil and good were unspoken of men and unheard:</l>
	<l n="70">They were shadows that willed as he would, that were made and unmade by his word.</l>
	<l n="71">His word was darkness and light, and a wisdom that makes men mad</l>
	<l n="72">Sent blindness upon them for sight, that they saw but and heard as he bade.</l>
	<l n="73">Cast forth and corrupt from the birth by the crime of creation, they stood</l>
	<l n="74">Convicted of evil on earth by the grace of a God found good.</l>
	<l n="75">The grace that enkindled and quickened the darkness of hell with flame</l>
	<l n="76">Bade man, though the soul in him sickened, obey, and give praise to his name.</l>
    <pb n="308" facs="acs0000001-06-325"/>
	<l n="77">The still small voice of the spirit whose life is as plague's hot breath</l>

	<l n="81">Yea, not nay, was the word: and the sacrifice offered withal</l>
	<l n="82">Was neither of beast nor of bird, but the soul of a man, God's thrall.</l>
	<l n="83">And the word of his servant spoken was fire, and the light of a sword,</l>
	<l n="84">When the bondage of Israel was broken, and Sinai shrank from the Lord.</l>
	<l n="85">With splendour of slaughter and thunder of song as the sound of the sea</l>
	<l n="86">Were the foes of him stricken in sunder and silenced as storms that flee.</l>
	<l n="87">Terror and trust and the pride of the chosen, approved of his choice,</l>
	<l n="88">Saw God in the whirlwind ride, and rejoiced as the winds rejoice.</l>
	<l n="89">Subdued and exalted and kindled and quenched by the sense of his might,</l>

    <pb n="309" facs="acs0000001-06-326"/>
	<l n="93">The chant of the prophetess, louder and loftier than tempest and wave,</l>
	<l n="94">Rang triumph more ruthless and prouder than death, and profound as the grave.</l>
	<l n="95">And sweet as the moon's word spoken in smiles that the blown clouds mar</l>
	<l n="96">The psalmist's witness in token arose as the speech of a star.</l>
	<l n="97">Starlight supreme, and the tender desire of the moon, were as one</l>
	<l n="98">To rebuke with compassion the splendour and strength of the godlike sun.</l>
	<l n="99">God softened and changed: and the word of his chosen, a fire at the first,</l>
	<l n="100">Bade man, as a beast or a bird, now slake at the springs his thirst.</l>
	<l n="101">The souls that were sealed unto death as the bones of the dead lie sealed</l>
	<l n="102">Rose thrilled and redeemed by the breath of the dawn on the flame-lit field.</l>
	<l n="103">The glories of darkness, cloven with music of thunder, shrank</l>
	<l n="104">As the web of the word was unwoven that spake, and the soul's tide sank.</l>
	<l n="105">And the starshine of midnight that covered Arabia with light as a robe</l>
	<l n="106">Waxed fiery with utterance that hovered and flamed through the whirlwind on Job.</l>
	<l n="107">And prophet to prophet and vision to vision made answer sublime,</l>
	<l n="108">Till the valley of doom and decision was merged in the tides of time.</l>

	<l n="210">Made God in his likeness, and bowed him to worship the Maker he made,</l>
	<l n="211">No faith more dire hath enticed man's trust than the saint's whose creed</l>
	<l n="212">Made Caiaphas one with Christ, that worms on the cross might feed.</l>
	<l n="213">Priests gazed upon God in the eyes of a babe new-born, and therein</l>
	<l n="214">Beheld not heaven, and the wise glad secret of love, but sin.</l>
	<l n="215">Accursed of heaven, and baptized with the baptism of hatred and hell,</l>
	<l n="216">They spat on the name they despised and adored as a sign and a spell.</l>

		<q next="#de77f2446">Lord Christ, thou art God, and a liar: they were children of wrath, not of grace,</q></l>

	<l n="219">Of such is the kingdom—he said it—of heaven: and the heavenly word</l>
	<l n="220">Shall live when religion is dead, and when falsehood is dumb shall be heard.</l>
	<l n="221">And the message of James and of John was as Christ's and as love's own call:</l>
	<l n="222">But wrath passed sentence thereon when Annas replied in Paul.</l>
	<l n="223">The dark old God who had slain him grew one with the Christ he slew,</l>
	<l n="224">And poison was rank in the grain that with growth of his gospel grew.</l>

	<l n="227">Through centuries of burning and trembling belief as a signal it shone,</l>
	<l n="228">Till man, soul-sick of dissembling, bade fear and her frauds begone.</l>
	<l n="229">God Cerberus yelps from his throats triune: but his day, which was night,</l>
	<l n="230">Is quenched, with its stars and the notes of its night-birds, in silence and light.</l>
	<l n="231">The flames of its fires and the psalms of their psalmists are darkened and dumb:</l>
	<l n="232">Strong winter has withered the palms of his angels, and stricken them numb.</l>
	<l n="233">God, father of lies, God, son of perdition, God, spirit of ill,</l>
	<l n="234">Thy will that for ages was done is undone as a dead God's will.</l>
	<l n="235">Not Mahomet's sword could slay thee, nor Borgia's or Calvin's praise:</l>
	<l n="236">But the scales of the spirit that weigh thee are weighted with truth, and it slays.</l>
	<l n="237">The song of the day of thy fury, when nature and death shall quail,</l>
	<l n="238">Rings now as the thunders of Jewry, the ghost of a dead world's tale.</l>
	<l n="239">That day and its doom foreseen and foreshadowed on earth, when thou,</l>
	<l n="240">Lord God, wast lord of the keen dark season, are sport for us now.</l>
	<l n="241">Thy claws were clipped and thy fangs plucked out by the hands that slew</l>

	<l n="248">Bade France and the world be wise, faith saw thee naked and shamed.</l>
	<l n="249">When wisdom deeper and sweeter than Rabelais veiled and revealed</l>
	<l n="250">Found utterance diviner and meeter for truth whence anguish is healed,</l>
	<l n="251">Whence fear and hate and belief in thee, fed by thy grace from above,</l>
	<l n="252">Fall stricken, and utmost grief takes light from the lustre of love,</l>
	<l n="253">When Shakespeare shone into birth, and the world he beheld grew bright,</l>
	<l n="254">Thy kingdom was ended on earth, and the darkness it shed was light.</l>
	<l n="255">In him all truth and the glory thereof and the power and the pride,</l>
	<l n="256">The song of the soul and her story, bore witness that fear had lied.</l>
	<l n="257">All hope, all wonder, all trust, all doubt that knows not of fear,</l>
	<l n="258">The love of the body, the lust of the spirit to see and to hear,</l>
    <pb n="318" facs="acs0000001-06-335"/>

	<l n="263">For the light that lived in the sound of the song of his speech was one</l>
	<l n="264">With the light of the wisdom that found earth's tune in the song of the sun;</l>
	<l n="265">His word with the word of the lord most high of us all on earth,</l>
	<l n="266">Whose soul was a lyre and a sword, whose death was a deathless birth.</l>
	<l n="267">Him too we praise as we praise our own who as he stand strong;</l>
	<l n="268">Him, <choice><orig>Æschylus</orig><reg>Aeschylus</reg></choice>, ancient of days, whose word is the perfect song.</l>
	<l n="269">When Caucasus showed to the sun and the sea what a God could endure,</l>
	<l n="270">When wisdom and light were one, and the hands of the matricide pure,</l>
	<l n="271">A song too subtle for psalmist or prophet of Jewry to know,</l>
	<l n="272">Elate and profound as the calmest or stormiest of waters that flow,</l>
	<l n="273">A word whose echoes were wonder and music of fears overcome,</l>
	<l n="274">Bade Sinai bow, and the thunder of godhead on Horeb be dumb.</l>
	<l n="275">The childless children of night, strong daughters of doom and dread,</l>
    <pb n="319" facs="acs0000001-06-336"/>
	<l n="276">The thoughts and the fears that smite the soul, and its life lies dead,</l>
	<l n="277">Stood still and were quelled by the sound of his word and the light of his thought,</l>
	<l n="278">And the God that in man lay bound was unbound from the bonds he had wrought.</l>
	<l n="279">Dark fear of a lord more dark than the dreams of his worshippers knew</l>
	<l n="280">Fell dead, and the corpse lay stark in the sunlight of truth shown true.</l>

                <l n="2">Smote England when his day bade Marlowe be.</l>
                <l n="3">No fire so keen had thrilled the clouds of time</l>
                <l n="4">Since Dante's breath made Italy sublime.</l>
                <l n="5">Earth, bright with flowers whose dew shone soft as tears,</l>
                <l n="6">Through Chaucer cast her charm on eyes and ears:</l>
                <l n="7">The lustrous laughter of the love-lit earth</l>
                <l n="8">Rang, leapt, and lightened in his might of mirth.</l>
                <l n="9">Deep moonlight, hallowing all the breathless air,</l>
                <l n="10">Made earth and heaven for Spenser faint and fair.</l>
                <l n="11">But song might bid not heaven and earth be one</l>
                <l n="12">Till Marlowe's voice gave warning of the sun.</l>
                <l n="13">Thought quailed and fluttered as a wounded bird</l>
                <l n="14">Till passion fledged the wing of Marlowe's word.</l>
                <l n="15">Faith born of fear bade hope and doubt be dumb</l>
                <l n="16">Till Marlowe's pride bade light or darkness come.</l>
                <l n="17">Then first our speech was thunder: then our song</l>
                <l n="18">Shot lightning through the clouds that wrought us wrong.</l>
                <l n="19">Blind fear, whose faith feeds hell with fire, became</l>
                <l n="20">A moth self-shrivelled in its own blind flame.</l>
                <l n="21">We heard, in tune with even our seas that roll,</l>
                <l n="22">The speech of storm, the thunders of the soul.</l>

                <l n="23">Men's passions, clothed with all the woes they wrought,</l>
                <l n="24">Shone through the fire of man's transfiguring thought.</l>
                <l n="25">The thirst of knowledge, quenchless at her springs,</l>
                <l n="26">Ambition, fire that clasps the thrones of kings,</l>
                <l n="27">Love, light that makes of life one lustrous hour,</l>
                <l n="28">And song, the soul's chief crown and throne of power,</l>
                <l n="29">The hungering heart of greed and ravenous hate,</l>
                <l n="30">Made music high as heaven and deep as fate.</l>
                <l n="31">Strange pity, scarce half scornful of her tear,</l>
                <l n="32">In Berkeley's vaults bowed down on Edward's bier.</l>
                <l n="33">But higher in forceful flight of song than all</l>
                <l n="34">The soul of man, its own imperious thrall,</l>
                <l n="35">Rose, when his royal spirit of fierce desire</l>
                <l n="36">Made life and death for man one flame of fire.</l>
                <l n="37">Incarnate man, fast bound as earth and sea,</l>
                <l n="38">Spake, when his pride would fain set Faustus free.</l>
                <l n="39">Eternal beauty, strong as day and night,</l>
                <l n="40">Shone, when his word bade Helen back to sight.</l>
                <l n="41">Fear, when he bowed the soul before her spell,</l>
                <l n="42">Thundered and lightened through the vaults of hell.</l>
                <l n="43">The music known of all men's tongues that sing,</l>
                <l n="44">When Marlowe sang, bade love make heaven of spring;</l>
                <l n="45">The music none but English tongues may make,</l>
                <l n="46">Our own sole song, spake first when Marlowe spake;</l>
                <l n="47">And on his grave, though there no stone may stand,</l>
                <l n="48">The flower it shows was laid by Shakespeare's hand.</l>

                <l n="29">Contagious godhead, seen, unknown, and heard,</l>
                <l n="30">Fulfilled and quickened England; thought and word,</l>
                <l n="31">When men would fain set life to music, grew</l>
                <l n="32">More sweet than years which knew not Shakespeare knew.</l>
                <l n="33">The simplest soul that set itself to song</l>
                <l n="34">Sang, and may fear not time's or change's wrong.</l>
                <l n="35">The lightest eye that glanced on life could see</l>
                <l n="36">Through grief and joy the God that man might be.</l>
                <l n="37">All passion whence the living soul takes fire</l>
                <l n="38">Till death fulfil despair and quench desire,</l>
                <l n="39">All love that lightens through the cloud of chance,</l>
                <l n="40">All hate that lurks in hope and smites askance,</l>
                <l n="41">All holiness of sorrow, all divine</l>
                <l n="42">Pity, whose tears are stars that save and shine,</l>
                <l n="43">All sunbright strength of laughter like the sea's</l>
                <l n="44">When spring and autumn loose their lustrous breeze,</l>
                <l n="45">All sweet, all strange, all sad, all glorious things,</l>
                <l n="46">Lived on his lips, and hailed him king of kings.</l>
                <l n="47">All thought, all strife, all anguish, all delight,</l>
                <l n="48">Spake all he bade, and speak till day be night.</l>
                <l n="49">No soul that heard, no spirit that beheld,</l>
                <l n="50">Knew not the God that lured them and compelled.</l>
                <l n="51">On Beaumont's brow the sun arisen afar</l>
                <l n="52">Shed fire which lit through heaven the younger star</l>
                <l n="53">That sank before the sunset: one dark spring</l>
                <l n="54">Slew first the kinglike subject, then the king.</l>
                <l n="55">The glory left above their graves made strong</l>
                <l n="56">The heart of Fletcher, till the flower-sweet song</l>
                <l n="57">That Shakespeare culled from Chaucer's field, and died,</l>
                <l n="58">Found ending on his lips that smiled and sighed.</l>
                <pb n="425" facs="acs0000001-06-442"/>
                <l n="59">From Dekker's eyes the light of tear-touched mirth</l>
                <l n="60">Shone as from Shakespeare's, mingling heaven and earth.</l>
                <l n="61">Wild witchcraft's lure and England's love made one</l>
                <l n="62">With Shakespeare's heart the heart of Middleton.</l>
                <l n="63">Harsh, homely, true, and tragic, Rowley told</l>
                <l n="64">His heart's debt down in rough and radiant gold.</l>
                <l n="65">The skies that Tourneur's lightning clove and rent</l>
                <l n="66">Flamed through the clouds where Shakespeare's thunder went.</l>
                <l n="67">Wise Massinger bade kings be wise in vain</l>
                <l n="68">Ere war bade song, storm-stricken, cower and wane.</l>
                <l n="69">Kind Heywood, simple-souled and single-eyed,</l>
                <l n="70">Found voice for England's home-born praise and pride.</l>
                <l n="71">Strange grief, strange love, strange terror, bared the sword</l>
                <l n="72">That smote the soul by grace and will of Ford.</l>
                <l n="73">The stern grim strength of Chapman's thought found speech</l>
                <l n="74">Loud as when storm at ebb-tide rends the beach:</l>
                <l n="75">And all the honey brewed from flowers in May</l>
                <l n="76">Made sweet the lips and bright the dreams of Day.</l>
                <l n="77">But even as Shakespeare caught from Marlowe's word</l>
                <l n="78">Fire, so from his the thunder-bearing third,</l>
                <l n="79">Webster, took light and might whence none but he</l>
                <l n="80">Hath since made song that sounded so the sea</l>
                <l n="81">Whose waves are lives of men—whose tidestream rolls</l>
                <l n="82">From year to darkening year the freight of souls.</l>
                <l n="83">Alone above it, sweet, supreme, sublime,</l>
                <l n="84">Shakespeare attunes the jarring chords of time;</l>
                <l n="85">Alone of all whose doom is death and birth,</l>
                <l n="86">Shakespeare is lord of souls alive on earth.</l>
