        <p> I <hi rendition="#sc">was</hi> allured into the audacity of this experiment by
          consideration of a fact which hitherto does not seem to have been taken into consideration
          by any translator of the half divine humourist in whose incomparable genius the highest
          qualities of Rabelais were fused and harmonized with the supremest gifts of <persName key="shelley">Shelley</persName>:
          namely, that his marvellous metrical invention of the anapæstic heptameter was almost
          exactly reproducible in a language to which all variations and combinations of anapæstic, 
          iambic, or trochaic metre are as natural and pliable as all dactylic and spondaic forms of
          verse are unnatural and abhorrent. As it happens, this highest central interlude of a most
          adorable masterpiece is as easy to detach from its dramatic setting, and even from its
          lyrical context, as it was easy to give line for line of it in English. In two metrical
          points only does my version vary from the verbal pattern of the original. I have of course
          added rhymes, and double rhymes, as necessary makeweights for the imperfection of an
          otherwise inadequate language; and equally of course I have not attempted the impossible
          and undesirable task of reproducing the rare exceptional effect of a line overcharged on
          purpose with a preponderance of heavy-footed spondees: and this for the obvious reason
          that even if such a line—which I doubt—could be exactly represented, foot by foot and
          pause for pause, in English, this English line would no more be a verse in any proper
          sense of the word than is the line I am writing at this moment. And my main intention, or
          at least my main desire, in the undertaking of this brief adventure, was to renew as far
          as possible for English ears the music of this resonant and triumphant metre, which goes
          ringing at full gallop as of horses who <cit rendition="#block">

				<l n="39">Nay, not so, but at least for a little, awhile at the golden</l>

				<l n="55">Over them air grows deeper, intense with delight in them: under</l>
				<l n="56" rendition="#ti-1">Things are thrilled in their sleep as with sense of a sure new

				<l n="57">But here by the sand-bank watching, with eyes on the sea-line, stranger</l>

				<l n="65">And the crests of it crumble and topple and change, but the wall is not
					broken:</l>
				<pb n="63" facs="acs0000001-05-078"/>
				<l n="66" rendition="#ti-1">Standing still dry-shod, I see it as higher than my head,</l>

				<l n="68" rendition="#ti-1">Still of impending wrath still in the foam of it shed.</l>
				<l n="69">And even in the pauses between them, dividing the rollers in sunder,</l>
				<l n="70" rendition="#ti-1">High overhead seems ever the sea-line fixed as a mark,</l>
				<l n="71">And the shore where I stand as a valley beholden of hills whence thunder</l>
				<l n="72" rendition="#ti-1">Cloud and torrent and storm, darkening the depths of the dark.</l>
				<l n="73">Up to the sea, not upon it or over it, upward from under</l>
				<l n="74" rendition="#ti-1">Seems he to gaze, whose eyes yearn after it here from the
					shore:</l>
				<l n="75">A wall of turbid water, aslope to the wide sky's wonder</l>
				<l n="76" rendition="#ti-1">Of colour and cloud, it climbs, or spreads as a slanted floor.</l>
				<l n="77">And the large lights change on the face of the mere like things that were
					living,</l>
				<l n="78" rendition="#ti-1">Winged and wonderful, beams like as birds are that pass and
					are free:</l>
				<l n="79">But the light is dense as darkness, a gift withheld in the giving,</l>
				<l n="80" rendition="#ti-1">That lies as dead on the fierce dull face of the landward sea.</l>
				<l n="81">Stained and stifled and soiled, made earthier than earth is and duller,</l>
				<l n="82" rendition="#ti-1">Grimly she puts back light as rejected, a thing put away:</l>
				<l n="83">No transparent rapture, a molten music of colour;</l>
				<l n="84" rendition="#ti-1">No translucent love taken and given of the day.</l>
				<pb n="64" facs="acs0000001-05-079"/>
				<l n="85">Fettered and marred and begrimed is the light's live self on her falling,</l>
				<l n="86" rendition="#ti-1">As the light of a man's life lighted the fume of a dungeon
					mars:</l>
				<l n="87">Only she knows of the wind, when her wrath gives ear to him calling;</l>
				<l n="88" rendition="#ti-1">The delight of the light she knows not, nor answers the sun or
					the stars.</l>
				<l n="89">Love she hath none to return for the luminous love of their giving:</l>
				<l n="90" rendition="#ti-1">None to reflect from the bitter and shallow response of her
					heart.</l>
				<l n="91">Yearly she feeds on her dead, yet herself seems dead and not living,</l>
				<l n="92" rendition="#ti-1">Or confused as a soul heavy-laden with trouble that will not
					depart.</l>
				<l n="93">In the sound of her speech to the darkness the moan of her evil remorse
					is,</l>
				<l n="94" rendition="#ti-1">Haply, for strong ships gnawed by the dog-toothed sea-bank's
					fang</l>
				<l n="95">And trampled to death by the rage of the feet of her foam-lipped horses</l>

				<l n="97">That wave in the foul faint air of the breath of a death-stricken city;</l>
				<l n="98" rendition="#ti-1">So menacing heaves she the manes of her rollers knotted with
					sand,</l>
				<l n="99">Discoloured, opaque, suspended in sign as of strength without pity,</l>
				<l n="100" rendition="#ti-1">That shake with flameless thunder the low long length of the
					strand.</l>
				<l n="101">Here, far off in the farther extreme of the shore as it lengthens</l>
				<pb n="65" facs="acs0000001-05-080"/>
				<l n="102" rendition="#ti-1">Northward, lonely for miles, ere ever a village begin,</l>

					strengthens</l>
				<l n="104" rendition="#ti-1">Shoreward, thrusting further and further its outworks in,</l>
				<l n="105">Here in <persName key="shakespeare">Shakespeare's</persName> vision, a flower of her kin forsaken,</l>
				<l n="106" rendition="#ti-1">Lay in her golden raiment alone on the wild wave's edge,</l>
				<l n="107">Surely by no shore else, but here on the bank storm-shaken,</l>
				<l n="108" rendition="#ti-1">Perdita, bright as a dew-drop engilt of the sun on the sedge.</l>
				<l n="109">Here on a shore unbeheld of his eyes in a dream he beheld her</l>
				<l n="110" rendition="#ti-1">Outcast, fair as a fairy, the child of a far-off king:</l>
				<l n="111">And over the babe-flower gently the head of a pastoral elder</l>
				<l n="112" rendition="#ti-1">Bowed, compassionate, hoar as the hawthorn-blossom in spring,</l>
				<l n="113">And kind as harvest in autumn: a shelter of shade on the lonely</l>
				<l n="114" rendition="#ti-1">Shelterless unknown shore scourged of implacable waves:</l>
				<l n="115">Here, where the wind walks royal, alone in his kingdom, and only</l>
				<l n="116" rendition="#ti-1">Sounds to the sedges a wail as of triumph that conquers and
					craves.</l>
				<l n="117">All these waters and wastes are his empire of old, and awaken</l>

					breath:</l>
				<pb n="66" facs="acs0000001-05-081"/>
				<l n="119">Yet the hunger is eased not that aches in his heart, nor the goal
					overtaken</l>
				<l n="120" rendition="#ti-1">That his wide wings yearn for and labour as hearts that yearn
					after death.</l>
				<l n="121">All the solitude sighs and expects with a blind expectation</l>
				<l n="122" rendition="#ti-1">Somewhat unknown of its own sad heart, grown heartsick of
					strife:</l>
				<l n="123">Till sometime its wild heart maddens, and moans, and the vast ululation</l>
				<l n="124" rendition="#ti-1">Takes wing with the clouds on the waters, and wails to be
					quit of its life.</l>
				<l n="125">For the spirit and soul of the waste is the wind, and his wings with
					their waving</l>
				<l n="126" rendition="#ti-1">Darken and lighten the darkness and light of it thickened or
					thinned;</l>
				<l n="127">But the heart that impels them is even as a conqueror's insatiably
					craving</l>
				<l n="128" rendition="#ti-1">That victory can fill not, as power cannot satiate the want
					of the wind.</l>
				<l n="129">All these moorlands and marshes are full of his might, and oppose not</l>
				<l n="130" rendition="#ti-1">Aught of defence nor of barrier, of forest or precipice
					piled:</l>
				<l n="131">But the will of the wind works ever as his that desires what he knows
					not,</l>
				<l n="132" rendition="#ti-1">And the wail of his want unfulfilled is as one making moan
					for her child.</l>
				<l n="133">And the cry of his triumph is even as the crying of hunger that maddens</l>
				<l n="134" rendition="#ti-1">The heart of a strong man aching in vain as the wind's heart
					aches</l>
				<l n="135">And the sadness itself of the land for its infinite solitude saddens</l>
				<pb n="67" facs="acs0000001-05-082"/>
				<l n="136" rendition="#ti-1">More for the sound than the silence athirst for the sound

				<l n="137">And the sunset at last and the twilight are dead: and the darkness is
					breathless</l>
				<l n="138" rendition="#ti-1">With fear of the wind's breath rising that seems and seems
					not to sleep:</l>
				<l n="139">But a sense of the sound of it alway, a spirit unsleeping and deathless,</l>
				<l n="140" rendition="#ti-1">Ghost or God, evermore moves on the face of the deep.</l>

<l n="61">Gods were yours yet strange to Turk or Galilean,</l>

<l n="66">By these only shall men conquer, by these only be set free:</l>
<l n="67">When the whole world's eye was Athens, these were yours, and theirs were ye.</l>
<l n="68">Light was given you of your wisdom, light ye gave the world again:</l>
<l n="69">As the sun whose godhead lightened on her soul was Hellas then:</l>
<l n="70">Yea, the least of all her children as the chosen of other men.</l>
<l n="71">Change your hearts not with your garments, nor your faith with creeds that change:</l>
<l n="72">Truth was yours, the truth which time and chance transform not nor estrange:</l>
<l n="73">Purer truth nor higher abides not in the reach of time's whole range.</l>
<l n="74">Gods are they in all men's memories and for all time's periods,</l>
<l n="75">They that hurled the host back seaward which had scourged the sea with rods:</l>
<l n="76">Gods for us are all your fathers, even the least of these as gods.</l>
<pb n="201" facs="acs0000001-05-216"/>
<l n="77">In the dark of days the thought of them is with us, strong to save,</l>
<l n="78">They that had no lord, and made the Great King lesser than a slave;</l>
<l n="79">They that rolled all Asia back on Asia, broken like a wave.</l>
<l n="80">No man's men were they, no master's and no God's but these their own:</l>
<l n="81">Gods not loved in vain nor served amiss, nor all yet overthrown:</l>
<l n="82">Love of country, Freedom, Wisdom, Light, and none save these alone.</l>
<l n="83">King by king came up against them, sire and son, and turned to flee:</l>

        				<l n="2">In a single adorable season whose life were a rapture of love and of laughter,</l>
        				<l n="3">And the blithest of singers were back with a song; if again from his tomb as from prison,</l>
        				<l n="4">If again from the night or the twilight of ages Aristophanes had arisen,</l>
        				<l n="5">With the gold-feathered wings of a bird that were also a god upon earth at his shoulders,</l>
        				<l n="6">And the gold-flowing laugh of the manhood of old at his lips, for a joy to beholders,</l>
        				<l n="7">He alone unrebuked of presumption were able to set to some adequate measure</l>
        				<l n="8">The delight of our eyes in the dawn that restores them the sun of their sense and the pleasure.</l>
        				<l n="9">For the days of the darkness of spirit are over for all of us here, and the season</l>
        				<l n="10">When desire was a longing, and absence a thorn, and rejoicing a word without reason.</l>
        				<l n="11">For the roof overhead of the pines is astir with delight as of jubilant voices,</l>
        				<l n="12">And the floor underfoot of the bracken and heather alive as a heart that rejoices.</l>
        				<pb n="369" facs="acs0000001-05-384"/>
        				<l n="13">For the house that was childless awhile, and the light of it darkened, the pulse of it dwindled,</l>
        				<l n="14">Rings radiant again with a child's bright feet, with the light of his face is rekindled.</l>
        				<l n="15">And the ways of the meadows that knew him, the sweep of the down that the sky's belt closes,</l>
        				<l n="16">Grow gladder at heart than the soft wind made them whose feet were but fragrant with roses,</l>
        				<l n="17">Though the fall of the year be upon us, who trusted in June and by June were defrauded,</l>
        				<l n="18">And the summer that brought us not back the desire of our eyes be gone hence unapplauded.</l>
        				<l n="19">For July came joyless among us, and August went out from us arid and sterile,</l>
        				<l n="20">And the hope of our hearts, as it seemed, was no more than a flower that the seasons imperil,</l>
        				<l n="21">And the joy of our hearts, as it seemed, than a thought which regret had not heart to remember,</l>
        				<l n="22">Till four dark months overpast were atoned for, and summer began in September.</l>
        				<l n="23">Hark, April again as a bird in the house with a child's voice hither and thither:</l>
        				<l n="24">See, May in the garden again with a child's face cheering the woods ere they wither.</l>
        				<l n="25">June laughs in the light of his eyes, and July on the sunbright cheeks of him slumbers,</l>
        				<l n="26">And August glows in a smile more sweet than the cadence of gold-mouthed numbers.</l>
        				<l n="27">In the morning the sight of him brightens the sun, and the noon with delight in him flushes,</l>
        				<l n="28">And the silence of nightfall is music about him as soft as the sleep that it hushes.</l>
        				<l n="29">We awake with a sense of a sunrise that is not a gift of the sundawn's giving,</l>
        				<pb n="370" facs="acs0000001-05-385"/>
        				<l n="30">And a voice that salutes us is sweeter than all sounds else in the world of the living,</l>
        				<l n="31">And a presence that warms us is brighter than all in the world of our visions beholden,</l>
        				<l n="32">Though the dreams of our sleep were as those that the light of a world without grief makes golden.</l>
        				<l n="33">For the best that the best of us ever devised as a likeness of heaven and its glory,</l>
        				<l n="34">What was it of old, or what is it and will be for ever, in song or in story,</l>
        				<l n="35">Or in shape or in colour of carven or painted resemblance, adored of all ages,</l>
        				<l n="36">But a vision recorded of children alive in the pictures of old or the pages?</l>
        				<l n="37">Where children are not, heaven is not, and heaven if they come not again shall be never:</l>
        				<l n="38">But the face and the voice of a child are assurance of heaven and its promise for ever.</l>
