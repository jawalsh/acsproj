## Notes
### 2022-01-28 to 2022-02-03 (Alex)
- Letters
    - I'm thinking that we shouldn't encode references to the footnotes to Swinburne's letters since they aren't actually his words. Opinions?
        - For the moment, differentiating using "n" in the @ref for pages.
    - The older edition of Swinburne's letters indicates when ACS or the editor is quoting from a work using an asterisk in the index. Am encoding the presence of the asterisk using @type="quote" on `<ref>`. 
    - Documenting how I think the letter references should be encoded. Feedback needed.
    - Translations of Swinburne's own works. Include? (ex: Albrecht's translation of _Atalanta in Calydon_)
    - ~~Add @status to each bibl? (present and absent?)~~
        - __No__ going to put "received" and "referenced" in taxonomy to fulfill these functions.
- Watts-Dunton
    - ~~Adding items that have "Swinburne's" in the description.~~ Done
        - Following format of entries from Sotheby's books since fits well and there's enough information to fill out that kind of information as opposed to the letters.
    - Need to check "from Swinburne" as well to get all presentation copies.
    - Using `<q>` to distinguish Swinburne's inscription/writing.
    - Not including proofs. Must be properly published and annotated, signed, etc. by Swinburne in order to be included.
### 2022-01-28
#### For next week(s)
- review indices of letters as sources of Swinburne's reading. 
    - Look at topics under Swinburne
    - Look at authors/works. Record info:
        - work
        - Letter date(s)
	- Document process for hourly help.
- Explore poetry files with xPath searches to find additional reading.
	- `epigraph`
	- `cit`
	- `head[contains(.,'Memory')]`
	- `head[contains(.,'for')]`
	- `head[contains(.,'For')]`
	- Check about 30, see if any of them are from books that aren't in the library
- Top 100
	- Determine if all authors are already represented in library.
	- For those who are not, decide what to draft.
	- Draft text explaining our process.
- Add `<floruit>`, `<birth>`, `<death>` to authors/publishers missing it. 
- Need rest of publishers from the auction catalog. Not all have authority files yet.
- Documenting author/publisher authority files
    - There are still uncertain authors/publishers in Alyssa's "Name Authority Issues" Google Doc
- Publication places need to be represented in the front. 
    - _There are 393 pubPlaces in the catalog, 251 have a @ref, so 142 need them. Not sure if all place names present in the catalogue have a listing in the authority list in `<front>`_
- Taxonomy of owned, annotated, presented_by, used
    - Connect in individual entries using @corresp. 
    - Document process for hourly help

### 2022-01-21 to 2022-01-27 (Alex)
- Watts-Dunton investigation
    - there are 110 hits which I think are presentation copies of Swinburne to Watts-Dunton
    - there are books that were Swinburne's, uses phrase "Swinburne's copy", 8 books
    - There are several books as well that say they have notes by Swinburne in them, but don't say whether they were a presentation copy to Watts-Dunton or Swinburne's own copy.
- T.J. Wise book is not useful to our investigation. Is about manuscripts and print books written by Swinburne.
