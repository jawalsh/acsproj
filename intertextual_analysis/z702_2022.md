### 2022-01-21 to 2022-01-27 (Alex)
- Watts-Dunton investigation
    - there are 110 hits which I think are presentation copies of Swinburne to Watts-Dunton
    - there are books that were Swinburne's, uses phrase "Swinburne's copy", 8 books
    - There are several books as well that say they have notes by Swinburne in them, but don't say whether they were a presentation copy to Watts-Dunton or Swinburne's own copy.
- T.J. Wise book is not useful to our investigation. Is about manuscripts and print books written by Swinburne.
