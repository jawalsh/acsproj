**DATA**
Swinburne data files are stored in $SWINBURNE_HOME/data

The data files use XInclude to include XML snippets stored in 
$SWINBURNE_HOME/data/includes

**ANT BUILD PROCESS**
An ant file, $SWINBURNE_HOME/build.xml, performs various tasks such as 
*validation
*generation of HTML, plain text, NINES RDF, etc.
*generation of "delivery" files, which are expanded versions of the files
 found in $SWINBURNE_HOME/data.  These "delivery" files resolve all the 
 XIncludes and serve as well-formed, stand-alone versions of the files.
 These are the version that are indexed in XTF and provided to the public and 
 colleagues who want XML versions of the Swinburne files.

Files generated by the ant processes are placed in $SWINBURNE_HOME/build.

The ant file may be read to determine additional files and libraries, e.g. 
jing, that are required for the build processes. 

**ID Scheme**
Swinburne IDs were originally meaningful, VVVTTTTTNN, where VVV was a
three-character code for a volume, e.g., PB1 for Poems and Ballads, First
Series; TTTTT was a five-character abbreviation for a work title, e.g.
lausv for "Laus Veneris"; and NN was a two digit number to identify a
specific version of a particular work.  This model proved to be inapplicable
in all situations and unsustainable as the project grew.

A new meaningless ID scheme has been established.  The new scheme follows
the pattern acsNNNNNNN.  "acs" identifies the files as part of the swinburne
collection and NNNNNNN is a unique number assigned to each object.
Suffixes may be added to this id to identify individual parts of a multi-volume
work.  For instance, the 1905 collected Poems are acs0000001, and the six
individual volumes are identified as acs0000001-01, acs0000001-02, etc.

All files have been renamed to adopt the new ID scheme.  The ID is the basis for the file name and also appears in TEI/@xml:id.  The old id has been retained, for backwards compatibility with NINES, and has been moved to TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt/idno[@type = 'nines'].
