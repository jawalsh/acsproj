<head>Erechtheus: A Tragedy. By Algernon Charles Swinburne.<lb/>1876.</head>
<p>The original holograph Manuscript, consisting of sixty-two folio leaves of white paper, mostly written upon one side only, and including in all seventy-nine pages of MS. In common with Swinburne’s early manuscripts, but unlike his later ones, which exhibit but few changes, the MS. of <title rendition="#i">Erechtheus</title> is crowded with corrections, alterations, and additions, in some places half a page at a time being marked out. Since no cmplete MS. of either _Atalanta in Calydon_ or _Tristram of Lyonesse_ has been preservered, I regard this noble volume as being the finest and most desireable Swinburne manuscript extant. It was given by the poet to Watts-Dunton, from whom I purchased it in September 1909. I give a greatly reduced facsimile of the first page; and also, in order to show the extent of deletion, an equally reduced facsimile of p. 48. Loosely inserted is an A.L.S. from Watts-Dunton to Swinburne, in which the writer remarks—
<quote rendition="#block #i"><emph rendition="#i">Don’t, pray, forget that I am to have the MS. of <title>‘Erechtheus’</title> Where is it?</emph></quote>
</p>
<p>Bound in red levant morocco by Riviere. The leaves measure 13¼ × 8⅜ inches.</p>

						<l>For land or sea to win by throw &amp; wear;</l>
						<l>Choose therefore or to quit thy side &amp; give</l>
						<l>The palm unfought for to his bloodless hand,</l>
						<l>Or by that father’s sceptre, &amp; the foot</l>
						<l>Whose tramp far off makes tremble for pure fear</l>
						<l>Thy soul-struck mother, piercing like a sword</l>
						<l>The immortal womb that bare thee; by the waves</l>
						<l>That no man bridles &amp; that bound thy world,</l>
						<l>And by the winds &amp; storms of all the sea,</l>
						<l>He swears to raze from eyeshot of the sun</l>
						<l>This city named not of his father’s name,</l>
						<l>And wash to deathward down one flood of doom</l>
						<l>This whole fresh brood of earth yeaned naturally,</l>
						<l>Green yet &amp; faint in its first blade, unblown</l>

						<l>Bruise her dear brow discrowned, nor snaffle or goad</l>
						<l>Wound her free mouth or stain her sanguine side</l>

						<l>Though thrice his might were mustered for our scathe</l>

						<l>That waves of inland &amp; the main make war</l>
						<l>As men that mix &amp; grapple; though his ranks</l>
						<l>Were more to number than all wildwood leaves</l>
						<l>The wind waves on the hills of all the world,</l>

						<l>Yet should the heart not faint, the head not fall,</l>
						<l>The breath not fail of Athens. Say, the Gods</l>
						<l>From lips that have no more on earth to say</l>
						<l>Have told thee this the last good news or ill</l>
						<l>That I shall speak in sight of earth &amp; sun</l>
						<l>Or he shall hear &amp; see them: for the next</l>
						<l>That ear of his from tongue of mine may take</l>
						<l>Must be the first word spoken underground</l>
						<l>From dead to dead in darkness. Hence; make haste,</l>
						<l>Lest war’s fleet foot be swifter than thy tongue</l>
						<l>And I that part not to return again</l>
						<l>On him that comes not to depart away</l>
						<l>Be fallen before thee; for the time is full,</l>

						<l>High things of strong-souled men that loved their land</l>
						<l>On brass &amp; stone are written, &amp; their deeds</l>
						<l>On high days chanted; but none graven or sung</l>
						<l>That ever set men’s eyes or spirits on fire,</l>
						<l>Athenians, has the sun’s height seen, or earth</l>
						<l>Heard in her depth reverberate as from heaven,</l>
						<l>More worth men’s praise &amp; good report of Gods</l>
						<l>Than here I bring for record in your ears.</l>

						<l>For now being come to the altar, where as priest</l>
						<l>Death ministering should meet her, &amp; his hand</l>
						<l>Seal her sweet eyes asleep, the maiden stood,</l>
						<l>With light in all her face as of a bride</l>
						<l>Smiling, or shine of festal flame by night</l>
						<l>Far flung from towers of triumph; &amp; her lips</l>
						<l>Trembled with pride in pleasure, that no fear</l>
						<l>Blanched them nor death before his time drank dry</l>
						<l>The blood whose bloom fulfilled them; for her cheeks</l>
						<l>Lightened, &amp; brighter than a bridal veil</l>
						<l>Her hair enrobed her bosom &amp; enrolled</l>
						<l>From face to feet the body’s whole soft length</l>
						<l>As with a cloud sun-saturate; then she spake</l>
						<l>With maiden tongue words manlike, but her eyes</l>
						<l>Lit mildly like a maiden’s: <q rendition="#i #nq">Countrymen,</q>
						</l>
						<l>
							<q rendition="#i #nq">With more goodwill &amp; height of happier heart</q>

						</l>
						<l>
							<q rendition="#i #nq">Than young men bound to battle.</q> Then with

						<l>Turned to the shadowiest part of all the shrine</l>

						<l>
							<q rendition="#i #nq">Take me, dear Gods</q>; &amp; as some form had

						<l>From the deep hollow shadow, some god’s tongue</l>

						<l>Set to the flower-sweet snow of her soft throat</l>
						<l>The sheer knife’s edge that severed it, &amp; loosed</l>
						<l>From the fair bondage of so spotless flesh</l>
						<l>So strong a spirit; &amp; all that girt them round</l>
						<l>Gazing, with souls that hung on that sad stroke,</l>
						<l>Groaned, &amp; kept silence after while a man</l>
						<l>Might count how far the fresh blood crept, &amp; bathed</l>
						<l>How deep the dark robe &amp; the bright shrine’s base</l>

						<l>Red-rounded with a running ring that grew</l>
						<l>More large &amp; duskier as the wells that fed</l>
						<l>Were drained of that pure effluence: but the queen</l>
						<l>Groaned not nor spake nor wept, but as a dream</l>
						<l>Floats out of eyes awakening so past forth</l>
						<l>Ghost-like, a shadow of sorrow, from all sight</l>

						<l>One fourfold flash &amp; thunder; yet a breath,</l>
						<l>And with the king’s spear through his red heart’s root</l>
						<l>Driven, like a rock split from its hill-side, fell</l>
						<l>Hurled under his own horsehoofs dead on earth</l>
						<l>The sea-beast that made war on earth from sea,</l>
						<l>Dumb, with no shrill note left of storming song,</l>
						<l>Eumolpus; &amp; his whole host with one stroke</l>
						<l>Spear-stricken through its dense deep iron heart</l>
						<l>Fell hurtling from us, &amp; in fierce recoil</l>
						<l>Drew seaward as with one wide wail of waves,</l>

						<l>Rose from the fluctuant refluence of its ranks,</l>
						<l>Sucked sullen back &amp; strengthless; but scarce yet</l>

						<l>Fallen, when from highest height of the sundering heaven</l>
						<l>The Father for his brother’s son’s sake slain</l>
						<l>Sent a sheer shaft of lightning writhen &amp; smote</l>
						<l>Right on his son’s son’s forehead, that unhelmed</l>
						<l>Shone like the star that shines down storm, &amp; gave</l>
						<l>Light to men’s eyes that saw thy lord their king</l>
						<l>Stand &amp; take breath from battle; then too soon</l>
						<l>Saw sink down as a sunset in sea-mist</l>
						<l>The high bright head that here in van of the earth</l>
						<l>Rose like a headland, &amp; through storm &amp; night</l>
						<l>Took all the sea’s wrath on it; &amp; now dead</l>
