						<l>Of all old sacred streams that wash the world,</l>
						<l>Ilissus, on whose marge at flowery play</l>
						<l>A whirlwind-footed bridegroom found my child</l>
						<l>And rapt her northward where mine elder-born</l>
						<l>Keeps now the Thracian bride-bed of a God</l>
						<l>Intolerable to seamen, but this land</l>
						<l>Finds him in hope for her sake favourable,</l>

						<l>The word I say be said, the gift be given,</l>
						<l>Which might I choose I had rather die than give</l>
						<l>Or speak and die not. Ere thy limbs were made</l>

						<l>Or thine eyes lightened, strife, thou knowest, my child,</l>
						<l>’Twixt God and God had risen, which heavenlier name</l>
						<l>Should here stand hallowed, whose more liberal grace</l>
						<l>Should win this city’s worship, and our land</l>
						<l>To which of these do reverence; first the lord</l>
						<l>Whose wheels make lightnings of the foam-flowered sea</l>
						<l>Here on this rock, whose height brow-bound with dawn</l>
						<l>Is head and heart of Athens, one sheer blow</l>
						<l>Struck, and beneath the triple wound that shook</l>
						<l>The stony sinews and stark roots of the earth</l>
						<l>Sprang toward the sun a sharp salt fount, and sank</l>
						<l>Where lying it lights the heart up of the hill,</l>
						<l>A well of bright strange brine; but she that reared</l>
						<l>Thy father with her same chaste fostering hand</l>
						<l>Set for a sign against it in our guard</l>
						<l>The holy bloom of the olive, whose hoar leaf</l>
						<l>High in the shadowy shrine of Pandrosus</l>
						<l>Hath honour of us all; and of this strife</l>
						<l>The twelve most high Gods judging with one mouth</l>
						<l>Acclaimed her victress; wroth whereat, as wronged</l>
						<l>That she should hold from him such prize and place,</l>
						<l>The strong king of the tempest-rifted sea</l>
						<l>Loosed reinless on the low Thriasian plain</l>
						<l>The thunders of his chariots, swallowing stunned</l>
						<l>Earth, beasts, and men, the whole blind foundering world</l>
						<l>That was the sun’s at morning, and ere noon</l>
						<l>Death’s; nor this only prey fulfilled his mind;</l>
						<l>For with strange crook-toothed prows of Carian folk</l>
						<l>Who snatch a sanguine life out of the sea,</l>

						<l>Thieves keen to pluck their bloody fruit of spoil</l>
						<l>From the grey fruitless waters, has their God</l>
						<l>Furrowed our shores to waste them, as the fields</l>
						<l>Were landward harried from the north with swords</l>
						<l>Aonian, sickles of man-slaughtering edge</l>
						<l>Ground for no hopeful harvest of live grain</l>
						<l>Against us in Boeotia; these being spent,</l>
						<l>Now this third time his wind of wrath has blown</l>
						<l>Right on this people a mightier wave of war,</l>
						<l>Three times more huge a ruin; such its ridge</l>
						<l>Foam-rimmed and hollow like the womb of heaven,</l>
						<l>But black for shining, and with death for life</l>
						<l>Big now to birth and ripe with child, full-blown</l>
						<l>With fear and fruit of havoc, takes the sun</l>
						<l>Out of our eyes, darkening the day, and blinds</l>
						<l>The fair sky’s face unseasonably with change,</l>
						<l>A cloud in one and billow of battle, a surge</l>
						<l>High reared as heaven with monstrous surf of spears</l>
						<l>That shake on us their shadow, till men’s heads</l>
						<l>Bend, and their hearts even with its forward wind</l>
						<l>Wither, so blasts all seed in them of hope</l>
						<l>Its breath and blight of presage; yea, even now</l>
						<l>The winter of this wind out of the deeps</l>
						<l>Makes cold our trust in comfort of the Gods</l>
						<l>And blind our eye toward outlook; yet not here,</l>
						<l>Here never shall the Thracian plant on high</l>
						<l>For ours his father’s symbol, nor with wreaths</l>
						<l>A strange folk wreathe it upright set and crowned</l>
						<l>Here where our natural people born behold</l>
						<l>The golden Gorgon of the shield’s defence</l>
						<l>That screens their flowering olive, nor strange Gods</l>
						<l>Be graced, and Pallas here have praise no more. <ptr type="note"
								target="#note_01"/></l>
						<l>And if this be not I must give my child,</l>
						<l>Thee, mine own very blood and spirit of mine,</l>

						<l>Thee to be slain. Turn from me, turn thine eyes</l>
						<l>A little from me; I can bear not yet</l>
						<l>To see if still they smile on mine or no,</l>
						<l>If fear make faint the light in them, or faith</l>
						<l>Fix them as stars of safety. Need have we,</l>
						<l>Sore need of stars that set not in mid storm,</l>
						<l>Lights that outlast the lightnings; yet my heart</l>
						<l>Endures not to make proof of thine or these,</l>
						<l>Not yet to know thee whom I made, and bare</l>
						<l>What manner of woman; had I borne thee man,</l>
						<l>I had made no question of thine eyes or heart,</l>
						<l>Nor spared to read the scriptures in them writ,</l>
						<l>Wert thou my son; yet couldst thou then but die</l>
						<l>Fallen in sheer fight by chance and charge of spears</l>
						<l>And have no more of memory, fill no tomb</l>
						<l>More famous than thy fellows in fair field,</l>
						<l>Where many share the grave, many the praise;</l>
						<l>But one crown shall one only girl my child</l>
						<l>Wear, dead for this dear city, and give back life</l>
						<l>To him that gave her and to me that bare,</l>
						<l>And save two sisters living; and all this,</l>
						<l>Is this not all good? I shall give thee, child,</l>
						<l>Thee but by fleshly nature mine, to bleed</l>
						<l>For dear land’s love; but if the city fall</l>
						<l>What part is left me in my children then? <ptr type="note"
								target="#df1708"/></l>
						<l>But if it stand and thou for it lie dead,</l>
						<l>Then hast thou in it a better part than we,</l>
						<l>A holier portion than we all; for each</l>
						<l>Hath but the length of his own life to live,</l>
						<l>And this most glorious mother-land on earth</l>
						<l>To worship till that life have end; but thine</l>
						<l>Hath end no more than hers; thou, dead, shalt live</l>
						<l>Till Athens live not; for the days and nights</l>
						<l>Given of thy bare brief dark dividual life,</l>

						<l>Shall she give thee half all her agelong own</l>
						<l>And all its glory; for thou givest her these;</l>
						<l>But with one hand she takes and gives again</l>
						<l>More than I gave or she requires of thee.</l>
						<l>Come therefore, I will make thee fit for death,</l>
						<l>I that could give thee, dear, no gift at birth</l>
						<l>Save of light life that breathes and bleeds, even I</l>
						<l>Will help thee to this better gift than mine</l>
						<l>And lead thee by this little living hand</l>
						<l>That death shall make so strong, to that great end</l>
						<l>Whence it shall lighten like a God’s, and strike</l>
						<l>Dead the strong heart of battle that would break</l>
						<l>Athens; but ye, pray for this land, old men,</l>
						<l>That it may bring forth never child on earth</l>
						<l>To love it less, for none may more, than we.</l>

						<l>Were their great will more grievous than it is,</l>
						<l>Not one but three, for this one thin-spun thread</l>

						<l>From the springs of the morning it thunders and lightens across and

						<l>To the wave where the moonset ends and the fall of the last low star.</l>
						<l>With a trampling of drenched red hoofs and an earth quake of men that

						<l>Strong war sets hand to the scythe, and the furrows take fire from his

						<l>Earth groans from her great rent heart, and the hollows of rocks are

						<l>From the roots of the hills to the plain’s dim verge and the dark loud

						<l>As the grinding of teeth in the jaws of a lion that foam as they

						<l>Is the shriek of the axles that loosen, the shock of the poles that

						<l>The dense manes darken and glitter, the mouths of the mad steeds

						<l>Their heads flash blind through the battle, and death’s foot rings in

						<l>For a fourfold host upon earth and in heaven is arrayed for the

						<l>White frontlet is dashed upon frontlet, and horse against horse reels

						<l>And the gorge of the gulfs of the battle is wide for the spoil of the

						<l>And the meadows are cumbered with shipwreck of chariots that founder on

						<l>And the horsemen are broken with breach as of breakers, and scattered as

						<l>Through the roar and recoil of the charges that mingle their cries and

						<l>Like fire are the notes of the trumpets that flash through the darkness

						<l>As the swing of the sea churned yellow that sways with the wind as it

						<l>Is the lift and relapse of the wave of the chargers that clash with their

						<l>And the clang of the sharp shrill brass through the burst of the wave as

						<l>Rings clean as the clear wind’s cry through the roar of the surge on the

						<l>And the heads of the steeds in their headgear of war, and their corsleted
							breasts,</l>
						<l>Gleam broad as the brows of the billows that brighten the storm with
							their crests,</l>
						<l>Gleam dread as their bosoms that heave to the shipwrecking wind as they
							rise,</l>
						<l>Filled full of the terror and thunder of water, that slays as it
							dies.</l>
						<l>So dire is the glare of their foreheads, so fearful the fire of their
							breath,</l>
						<l>And the light of their eyeballs enkindled so bright with the lightnings
							of death;</l>
						<l>And the foam of their mouths as the sea’s when the jaws of its gulf are
							as graves,</l>
						<l>And the ridge of their necks as the wind-shaken mane on the ridges of
							waves:</l>
						<l>And their fetlocks afire as they rear drip thick with a dewfall of
							blood</l>
						<l>As the lips of the rearing breaker with froth of the manslaying
							flood.</l>
						<l>And the whole plain reels and resounds as the fields of the sea by
							night</l>
						<l>When the stroke of the wind falls darkling, and death is the seafarer’s

						<l>And with the king’s spear through his red heart’s root</l>
						<l>Driven, like a rock split from its hill-side, fell</l>
						<l>Hurled under his own horsehoofs dead on earth</l>
						<l>The sea-beast that made war on earth from sea,</l>
						<l>Dumb, with no shrill note left of storming song,</l>
						<l>Eumolpus; and his whole host with one stroke</l>
						<l>Spear-stricken through its dense deep iron heart</l>
						<l>Fell hurtling from us, and in fierce recoil</l>
						<l>Drew seaward as with one wide wail of waves,</l>
						<l>Resorbed with reluctation; such a groan</l>
						<l>Rose from the fluctuant refluence of its ranks,</l>
						<l>Sucked sullen back and strengthless; but scarce yet</l>

						<l>Fallen, when from highest height of the sundering heaven</l>
						<l>The Father for his brother’s son’s sake slain</l>
						<l>Sent a sheer shaft of lightning writhen and smote</l>
						<l>Right on his son’s son’s forehead, that unhelmed</l>
						<l>Shone like the star that shines down storm, and gave</l>
						<l>Light to men’s eyes that saw thy lord their king</l>
						<l>Stand and take breath from battle; then too soon</l>
						<l>Saw sink down as a sunset in sea-mist</l>
						<l>The high bright head that here in van of the earth</l>
						<l>Rose like a headland, and through storm and night</l>
						<l>Took all the sea’s wrath on it; and now dead</l>

						<l>Hear, men that mourn, and woman without mate,</l>
						<l>Hearken; ye sick of soul with fear, and thou</l>

						<l>Dumb-stricken for thy children; hear ye too,</l>
						<l>Earth, and the glory of heaven, and winds of the air,</l>
						<l>And the most holy heart of the deep sea,</l>
						<l>Late wrath, now full of quiet; hear thou, sun,</l>
						<l>Rolled round with the upper fire of rolling heaven</l>
						<l>And all the stars returning; hills and streams,</l>
						<l>Springs and fresh fountains, day that seest these deeds,</l>
						<l>Night that shalt hide not; and thou child of mine,</l>
						<l>Child of a maiden, by a maid redeemed,</l>
						<l>Blood-guiltless, though bought back with innocent blood,</l>
						<l>City mine own; I Pallas bring thee word,</l>
						<l>I virgin daughter of the most high God</l>
						<l>Give all you charge and lay command on all</l>
						<l>The word I bring be wasted not; for this</l>
						<l>The Gods have stablished and his soul hath sworn,</l>
						<l>That time nor earth nor changing sons of man</l>
						<l>Nor waves of generations, nor the winds</l>
						<l>Of ages risen and fallen that steer their tides</l>
						<l>Through light and dark of birth and lovelier death</l>
						<l>From storm toward haven inviolable, shall see</l>
						<l>So great a light alive beneath the sun</l>
						<l>As the awless eye of Athens; all fame else</l>
						<l>Shall be to her fame as a shadow in sleep</l>
						<l>To this wide noon at waking; men most praised</l>
						<l>In lands most happy for their children found</l>
						<l>Shall hold as highest of honours given of God</l>
						<l>To be but likened to the least of thine,</l>
						<l>Thy least of all, my city; thine shall be</l>
						<l>The crown of all songs sung, of all deeds done</l>
						<l>Thine the full flower for all time; in thine hand</l>
						<l>Shall time be like a sceptre and thine head</l>
						<l>Wear worship for a garland; nor one leaf</l>
						<l>Shall change or winter cast out of thy crown</l>

						<l>Till all flowers wither in the world; thine eyes</l>
						<l>Shall first in man’s flash lightning liberty,</l>
						<l>Thy tongue shall first say freedom; thy first hand</l>
						<l>Shall loose the thunder terror as a hound</l>
						<l>To hunt from sunset to the springs of the sun</l>
						<l>Kings that rose up out of the populous east</l>
						<l>To make their quarry of thee, and shall strew</l>
						<l>With multitudinous limbs of myriad herds</l>
						<l>The foodless pastures of the sea, and make</l>
						<l>With wrecks immeasurable and unsummed defeat</l>
						<l>One ruin of all their many-folded flocks</l>
						<l>Ill shepherded from Asia; by thy side</l>
						<l>Shall fight thy son the north wind, and the sea</l>
						<l>That was thine enemy shall be sworn thy friend</l>
						<l>And hand be struck in hand of his and thine</l>
						<l>To hold faith fast for aye; with thee, though each</l>
						<l>Make war on other, wind and sea shall keep</l>
						<l>Peace, and take truce as brethren for thy sake</l>
						<l>Leagued with one spirit and single-hearted strength</l>
						<l>To break thy foes in pieces, who shall meet</l>
						<l>The wind’s whole soul and might of the main sea</l>
						<l>Full in their face of battle, and become</l>
						<l>A laughter to thee; like a shower of leaves</l>
						<l>Shall their long galleys rank by staggering rank</l>
						<l>Be dashed adrift on ruin, and in thy sight</l>
						<l>The sea deride them, and that lord of the air</l>
						<l>Who took by violent hand thy child to wife</l>
						<l>With his loud lips bemock them, by his breath</l>
						<l>Swept out of sight of being; so great a grace</l>
						<l>Shall this day give thee, that makes one in heart</l>
						<l>With mine the deep sea’s godhead, and his son</l>
						<l>With him that was thine helmsman, king with king,</l>
						<l>Dead man with dead; such only names as these</l>
						<l>Shalt thou call royal, take none else or less</l>

						<l>To hold of men in honour; but with me</l>
						<l>Shall these be worshipped as one God, and mix</l>
						<l>With mine the might of their mysterious names</l>
						<l>In one same shrine served singly, thence to keep</l>
						<l>Perpetual guard on Athens; time and change,</l>
						<l>Masters and lords of all men, shall be made</l>
						<l>To thee that knowest no master and no lord</l>
						<l>Servants; the days that lighten heaven and nights</l>
						<l>That darken shall be ministers of thine</l>
						<l>To attend upon thy glory, the great years</l>
						<l>As light-engraven letters of thy name</l>
						<l>Writ by the sun’s hand on the front of the earth</l>
						<l>For world-beholden witness; such a gift</l>
						<l>For one fair chaplet of three lives enwreathed</l>
						<l>To hang for ever from thy storied shrine,</l>
						<l>And this thy steersman fallen with tiller in hand</l>
						<l>To stand for ever at thy ship’s helm seen,</l>
						<l>Shall he that bade their threefold flower be shorn</l>
						<l>And laid him low that planted, give thee back</l>
						<l>In sign of sweet land reconciled with sea</l>
						<l>And heavenlike earth with heaven; such promise-pledge</l>
						<l>I daughter without mother born of God</l>
						<l>To the most woful mother born of man</l>
						<l>Plight for continual comfort. Hail, and live</l>
						<l>Beyond all human hap of mortal doom</l>
