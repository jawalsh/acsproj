# Swinburne's Library: READ ME

This file describes the swinburne_library.xml file. 

The contents of the catalogue items were gathered from *Sales Catalogues of Libraries of Eminent Persons*, general editory A. N. L. Munby, Litt. D., Volume 6: Poets and Men of Letters, edited by John Wooldford, 1972, pages 247-336. The items were listed by the size, day, then lot in which they were sold, and the structure of the xml file reflects this. All of the information given by the sales catalogue is included in the xml file, including by not limited to author, title, year(s)/location of publication, any notes given about the item, and inscriptions. The order of the items in the catalogue is maintained in the xml file. One feature of note found in the cataliogue is the "etc" which, as far as we know, represents a count of items that were also sold in each lot but were not listed in the sales catalogue. These "etc"s were tracked in order to have as accurate a count of the total number of items in Swinburne's library as possible, though this particular fact was not necessarily relevant to the research. The xml file follows the TEI schema.
