A Note on the Texts. 

The core of _The Swinburne Project_ consists of digital representations of Swinburne's works. Around this core are assembled multiple paratextual layers that explore various documentary and literary dimensions of the texts. The digital representations of Swinburne's works have been prepared according to the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/) (TEI) [_Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange_](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index-toc.html).


While there is a diplomatic faithfulness to the source texts, we are conscious that we are necessarily creating a new text with an ever-growing amount of scholarly commentary, annotation, and additional paratextual layers. 

#Published Poems
The sources for texts in the Swinburne Project are various. To date the _Swinburne Project_ has focused on documents Swinburne himself saw through the press, in particular the six-volume _Poems of Algernon Charles Swinburne_ (1904), which gathers all the individual collections of poetry from _Poems and Ballads, First Series_ (1866) through _A Channel Passage and Other Poems_ (1904). Also included in the six-volume _Poems_ are the lyrical dramas _Atalanta in Calydon_ (1865) and _Erechtheus_ (1876) and the long Arthurian narratives _Tristram of Lyonesse_ and _The Tale of Balen_ and the lyrical dramas. The 1904 _Poems_ is a reliable text and is the standard text cited in Swinburne scholarship. The Swinburne Project edition corrects errors as they are identified, and these errors and corrections are recorded in the TEI/XML encoded text. For instance, the 1904 text "Her curled air next hit had the wave of sea-water" should read "Her curled hair next hit had the wave of sea-water."  See the encoding that records this error and correction: 

`<l n="36">
    Her curled <choice><sic>air</sic><corr>hair</corr></choice> had the wave of sea-water
</l>`

Wise's _Bibliography_ is an important and useful source of information, though marred by the inclusion of spurious pamphlets forged by Wise himself. The Bonchurch Edition of Swinburne's works, edited by Gosse and Wise, and published in 19XX is considered unreliable, “misleading in arrangement and omissions and is often corrupt” {Hyder, 1970, #22600@xi}.
